.QL (pronounced "dot-cue-el") is an object-oriented query language used to retrieve data from relational database management systems. It is reminiscent of the standard query language [[SQL]] and the object-oriented programming language [[Java]]. .QL is an object-oriented variant of a [[logic programming]] language known in the databases community as [[Datalog]]. Hierarchical data can therefore be naturally queried in .QL in a recursive manner.
