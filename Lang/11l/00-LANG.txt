}}11l (elevenel) is a [semi-esoteric] high-level general-purpose programming language, which provides a simple and direct mapping to hardware and aims to follow a zero-overhead principle, like C++. 11l is statically typed, but feels very much like a dynamically typed language (e.g. Python).
The design of 11l is aimed to achieve as much conciseness as possible.

The evident distinction of 11l from all other existing programming languages is its keywords are organized in a tree, not just a list.
There are 11 keywords at the root of that tree, and each word can be written as one letter:<br />
C, I, E, F, L, N, R, S, T, V, X.
