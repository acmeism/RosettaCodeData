IBM 360 assembly language.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

ASM360, Assembler 360, 360 assembly, or Basic Assembly Language (BAL) are the commonly 
used terms for a low-level programming language used on IBM System/360 
and successor mainframes. 
Originally "Basic Assembly Language" applied only to an extremely restricted 
dialect designed to run under control of IBM Basic Programming Support 
(BPS/360) on systems with only 8KB of main memory, and only a card reader, 
a card punch, and a printer for input/output — thus the word "Basic". 
However, the full name and the initialism "BAL" almost immediately attached 
themselves in popular use to all assembly-language dialects on the System/360 and 
its descendants. The 360 assembly was introduced with the System/360 in 1964.
