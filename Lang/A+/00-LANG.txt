A+ is an array programming language, which is derived from the programming language [[derived from::A]], a dialect of [[APL]] with aggressive extensions. Arthur Whitney developed the "A" portion of A+, while other developers at Morgan Stanley extended it, adding a graphical user interface and other language features. A+ was designed for numerically intensive applications, especially those found in financial applications. A+ runs on many Unix variants, including Linux. A+ is a high-level, interactive, interpreted language.[[#Citation|[1]]]
