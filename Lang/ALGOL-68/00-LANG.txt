ALGOL 68 (short for ALGOrithmic Language 1968) is an [[imperative programming|imperative]] computer programming language that was conceived as a successor to the ALGOL 60 programming language, designed with the goal of a much wider scope of application and more rigorously defined syntax and semantics.

The main aims and principles of design of ALGOL 68:
#Completeness and clarity of design,
#Orthogonal design,
#Security,
#Efficiency: 
#* Static mode checking,
#* Mode-independent parsing,
#* Independent compilation,
#* Loop optimization,
#* Representations - in minimal & larger character sets.

==Grammar==
The formal definition of Algol 68 is given by a "Two-Level" or [[wp:Van Wijngaarden grammar|"Van Wijngaarden" grammar]].
This specifies much more than "just" the syntax and includes such semantic details as the requirement of identifiers to be declared, the necessary type checking and coercions to be applied, etc. The degree of precision allowed by the grammar came at the cost of increased complexity relative to Backus Naur Form, which was used to define [[ALGOL 60]]. It is recomended that less formal material (such as the books mentioned under "Resources" below) be consulted before delving into the Revised Report.

Many of the code samples provided here have a leading <code>main:(</code> and a matching <code>)</code> at the end. These are not actually required in the language, but are included so as to highlight the main routine.

On some compilers, it may be necessary to include appropriate "job cards" 
or preludes in order for the programs to compile successfully. Hopefully 
not too much else is required. Examples:
{|border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 5px double grey;"  align="center"

|| Algol68 as in rosettacode
|| Actual ELLA Algol 68RS code

 )
||
 PROGRAM helloworld CONTEXT VOID

   print(("Hello, world!", new line))
 END

<br><br>'''Alphabets'''
<br><br>
Notionally, Algol 68 source is written in two alphabets. The reserved words, mode indicants (type names) and operators that are non-symbolic (.e.g. '''and''', '''or''', ...) are generally referred to as "bold words" and usually shown in a bold font in literature. Words that are identifiers (used for "variable" names, procedure names, structure member names, ...) are in a separate, non-bold font.<br>
The [https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/manual/a68s.txt/view Manual for CMU ALGOL 68S (on softwarepreservation.org)] refers to the non-bold words as being in timid face.
<br><br>'''Examples of different program representations'''
<br><br>
At the time when ALGOL 68 was defined some predominant computers had 
24 or 36 bit words, with 6 bit character sets.  Hence it was desirable that
ALGOL 68 should be able to run on machines with only uppercase.
As multiple fonts were generally unavailable, a method of identifying the bold words was required.<br>
The official spec provided for different representations of the same 
program.
Quote stropping (enclosing the bold words in single quotes)
and Point stropping (preceeding the bold words with a dot)
were used.<br>
A variant of Point stropping called RES stropping was also defined.
In RES stropping some language-defined bold words are not preceded by a dot.<br>
A pragmatic comment may have been required to indicate which
stropping convention was to be used, as in some of the examples below.<br>
Upper stropping (representing the bold words by upper case and
non-bold words in lower case) was introduced by Algol 68R.<br>
Upper stropping is used by Algol 68RS and is one of the options for Algol 68G.<br>
Rutgers ALGOL 68 uses quote stropping.<br>
Most of the samples on Rosetta Code use Upper stropping.<br><br>
Examples (pragmatic comments to set the stropping regime not shown):
{|border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 2px double grey;"  align="left" 
|| Algol68 as typically published
 '''mode''' '''xint''' = '''int''';
 '''xint''' sum sq:=0;
 '''for''' i '''while'''
   sum sq≠70&times;70
 '''do'''
   sum sq+:=i↑2
 '''od''' 
|| QUOTE stropping (similar to wiki)
 'mode' 'xint' = 'int';
 'xint' sum sq:=0;
 'for' i 'while'
   sum sq≠70&times;70
 'do'
   sum sq+:=i↑2

 FOR i WHILE
   sum sq /= 70*70
 DO

== Coercion (casting) ==
ALGOL 68 has a hierarchy of contexts which determine which kind of coercions are available at a particular point in the program.

|colspan=1 bgcolor=ffcccc|
Widening occurs if there is no loss of precision. For example: An INT will be coerced to a REAL, and a REAL will be coerced to a LONG REAL.  But not vice-versa.  Examples:
<syntaxhighlight algol68>INT to LONG INT
INT to REAL
REAL to COMPL
BITS to []BOOL
BYTES to STRING</syntaxhighlight>
A variable can also be coerced (rowed) to an array of length 1.  

For example:
<syntaxhighlight algol68>INT to [1]INT
REAL to [1]REAL</syntaxhighlight> etc
