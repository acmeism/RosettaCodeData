Algol W is a successor to [[wp:Algol 60|Algol 60]] closely based on A
Contribution to the Development of ALGOL by [[wp:Niklaus Wirth|Niklaus Wirth]] 
and [[wp:C.A.R. Hoare|C. A. R. Hoare]]. It includes dynamically
allocated records, string handling, complex numbers and a standard I/O
system. A copy of the Algol W Language Description can be found on Karl
Kleine's [http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/history.html Historic Documents in Computer Science] 
page. [http://everything2.com/title/Algol%2520W Dabcanboulet's Algol W @ Everything2] 
page contains an excellent
history and tutorial.

[http://tiddly-pom.com/~glyn/ Awe] is a new compiler for the Algol W
language. It is a complete implementation of the language described in
the [https://tiddly-pom.com/~glyn/algolw.pdf Algol W Language Description, June 1972]. Awe should be able to
compile code intended for the [[wp:OS/360|OS/360]] Algol W compilers
with little or no modification. See the Awe manual for more details.

Awe correctly compiles Tony Marsland's computer [[wp:chess|chess]] player
[http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~tony/Public/Awit-Wita-ComputerChess/ Awit] 
and Hendrik Boom's [http://mtn-host.prjek.net/projects/a68h/ A68H]
[[Algol 68]] compiler.
