Algol W was designed as a successor to [[wp:Algol 60|Algol 60]], closely based on A
Contribution to the Development of ALGOL by [[wp:Niklaus Wirth|Niklaus Wirth]] 
and [[wp:C.A.R. Hoare|C. A. R. Hoare]]. It includes dynamically
allocated records, string handling, complex numbers and a standard I/O
system. A description of the Algol W Language as at 1972 can be found at [https://bitsavers.org/pdf/stanford/cs_techReports/STAN-CS-71-230_Algol_W_Reference_Manual_Feb72.pdf Algol W Reference Manual 1972 on bitsavers.org] 
page. [http://everything2.com/title/Algol%2520W Dabcanboulet's Algol W @ Everything2] 
page contains an excellent
history and tutorial.
