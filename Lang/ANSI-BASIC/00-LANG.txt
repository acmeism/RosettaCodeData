'''ANSI BASIC''' ('''Full BASIC''') is a standard for the [[BASIC]] programming language. It is specified in ANSI X3.113-1987 ("Programming Languages Full BASIC"). The same standard was specified in INCITS/ISO/IEC 10279-1991 ("Information Technology – Programming Languages – Full BASIC"). The standard is called "Full BASIC" to distinguish it from [[Minimal BASIC]] which is another standard established by ANSI, ISO, and ECMA.

ECMA, in ECMA-116 (1986), defined a subset of the ANSI BASIC Standard, ANSI X3.113-198X. The specification is divided into three parts: ECMA BASIC-1, ECMA BASIC-2, and ECMA Graphics Module. ECMA Standard is fully upward compatible with corresponding implementations of the ANSI Standard.
