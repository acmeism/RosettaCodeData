'''ASIC''' ("Almost BASIC") is a compiler and integrated development environment for a subset of the [[BASIC]] programming language. It was released for [[MS-DOS]] and compatible systems as shareware. Written by Dave Visti of 80/20 Software, it was one of the few BASIC compilers legally available for download from Bulletin board systems. ASIC allows compiling to an EXE or COM file.
