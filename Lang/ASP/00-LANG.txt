'''Active Server Pages''', usually abbreviated as '''ASP''', is a scripting engine for web servers. Although developed by [[Microsoft]], and used almost exclusively under [[wp:Internet Information Services|IIS]], there are a few third-party implementations, most notably [http://www.apache-asp.org/ Apache::ASP] (and, before the Oracle buyout, Sun's Chilisoft ASP).

By default, the Microsoft implementation of ASP includes [[:Category:VBScript|VBScript]] and [[:Category:JavaScript|JavaScript]], but can be extended to use other languages, such as [[wp:PerlScript|PerlScript]] (derived from [[:Category:Perl|Perl]]).
