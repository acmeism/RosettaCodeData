'''ATS''' is a [[Type checking|statically typed]] programming language that unifies implementation with formal specification. It is equipped with a highly expressive [[type system]] rooted in the framework Applied Type System, which gives the language its name. In particular, both dependent types and linear types are available in ATS.



* [[Functional programming]]. The core of ATS is a functional language based on eager (aka. call-by-value) evaluation, which can also accommodate lazy (aka. call-by-need) evaluation. The availability of linear types in ATS often makes functional programs written in it run not only with surprisingly high efficiency (when compared to [[C]]) but also with surprisingly small (memory) footprint (when compared to [[C]] as well).

* [[Imperative programming]]. The novel and unique approach to imperative programming in ATS is firmly rooted in the paradigm of programming with theorem-proving. The type system of ATS allows many features considered dangerous in other languages (e.g., explicit pointer arithmetic and explicit memory allocation/deallocation) to be safely supported in ATS, making ATS a viable programming langauge for low-level systems programming.

* [[Concurrent programming]]. ATS, equipped with a multicore-safe implementation of [[garbage collection]], can support multithreaded programming through the use of pthreads. The availability of linear types for tracking and safely manipulating resources provides a effective means to constructing reliable programs that can take advantage of multicore architectures.

* [[Modular programming]]. The module system of ATS is largely infuenced by that of [[Modula-3]], which is both simple and general as well as effective in supporting large scale programming.



In addition, ATS contains a subsystem ATS/LF that supports a form of (interactive) theorem-proving, where proofs are constructed as total functions. With this component, ATS advocates a programmer-centric approach to program verification that combines programming with theorem-proving in a syntactically intertwined manner. Furthermore, this component can serve as a logical framework for encoding deduction systems and their (meta-)properties.
