Ada was initially standardized by [[ANSI]] in 1983 and by [[ISO]] in 1987. This version of the language is commonly known as [[Ada 83]].  The next version was standardized by ISO in 1995 (ISO/IEC 8652:1995) and is commonly known as [[Ada 95]].  Following that ISO published ISO/IEC 8652:1995/Amd 1:2007 in 2007, which is commonly known as [[Ada 2005]].  Most recently ISO published [http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/12rm/html/RM-TTL.html ISO/IEC 8652:2012(E)], commonly known as [[Ada 2012]].  Formally only the most recent version of the language is known as '''Ada'''.

The language is named after [[wp:Ada_Lovelace|Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace]] thought to be the first ever programmer. Initially it was designed for [http://www.defense.gov U.S. Department of Defense]. The language is used for large and mission-critical systems. See [[wp:Ada_(programming_language)|also]].
