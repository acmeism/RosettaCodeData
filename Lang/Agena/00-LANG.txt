== What is Agena ? ==
Agena is an easy-to-learn procedural programming language designed to be used in scientific, educational, linguistic, and many other applications. 

== What can you do with Agena ? == 
Agena provides all the means to implement ideas quickly: fast real and complex arithmetics, efficient text processing, graphics, flexible data structures, intelligent procedures, simple package management, plus various configuration facilities in multi-user environments.

Besides providing basic operations, it has advanced programming features such as high-speed processing of data structures,
extended conditionals, abridged and extended syntax for loops, efficient recursion techniques, an arbitrary precision mathematical library, easy-to-use package handling, and much more.

== Which operating systems are supported ? == 
Installers are available for [[Solaris]], [[Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[OS/2]] & eComStation, and DOS.

== How does it look like ? ==
The syntax looks like very simplified [[ALGOL 68]] with elements taken from [[Lua]] and [[SQL]]. 

== How has it been implemented ? ==
Agena is based on the [[ANSI]] [[C]] source code of [[Lua]], a popular and widely used Open Source programming language.
