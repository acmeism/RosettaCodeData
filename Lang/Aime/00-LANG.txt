}}{{language programming paradigm|Imperative}}[[derived from::C| ]]
''aime'' is a simple, [[C|C]]-like, [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[imperative programming|imperative]] computer programming language.  It is designed as a lightweight language targeted towards application extension [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_category#Extension_languages].  As such, the aime interpreter is easily embeddable in other applications.  For the same reasons, the language stresses application integrity and accessibility.
