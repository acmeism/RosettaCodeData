{{language programming paradigm|Object-oriented}}

Alore is an [[object-oriented programming]] language with a clean syntax that resembles [[Python]] and [[Lua]]. Alore is optionally-typed like Google Dart: it is both a dynamic scripting language and a general-purpose language with static typing. It is aimed at diverse programming tasks, from short scripts to complex applications. Alore also allows you to freely mix static and dynamic typing within a program.
