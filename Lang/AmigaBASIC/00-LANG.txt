AmigaBASIC (also called Amiga Basic in manuals) is an interpreted BASIC implementation for the range of [[wp:Commodore Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] home computers, designed and written by [[wp:Microsoft|Microsoft]]. AmigaBASIC shipped with [[wp:AmigaOS|AmigaOS]] versions 1.1 to 1.3 between 1985 and 1990.

AmigaBASIC had some advanced features for its time such as subroutines with local variables, text labels instead of line numbers, and various graphics commands e.g. for animation and collision detection. The AmigaOS GUI with its screens, mouse interaction, menus etc. was also supported from AmigaBASIC.

Execution speed however was not a particular strength of AmigaBASIC. Some 8-bit BASICs such as [[:Category:Locomotive Basic|Locomotive Basic]] were much faster for simple algorithms than AmigaBASIC. Clearly the convenience and advanced features of AmigaBASIC came at a price in terms of performance.

AmigaBASIC was superseded by [[wp:ARexx|ARexx]], a REXX-style scripting language, from AmigaOS version 2.0 onwards. The 1.x AmigaBASIC binary also works on AmigaOS 2, but not on AmigaOS 3.
