<cite>E is an object-oriented/procedural/unpure functional/whatever language with quite a popular implementation on the amiga. It's mainly influenced by languages such as C++, Ada, Lisp etc.</cite> (from the official site)

Do not confuse [[E]] with AmigaE. Amiga E was born in 1993, E in 1997. Unluckily, they share the same name, and since Amiga E is the most popular (as far as I know, unique...!) implementation of E, and since Amiga E has some features that bind it to ''Amiga family'', the name AmigaE seems reasonable, even though HOPL reports it as E.

The language was designed by Wouter van Oortmerssen, also the perpetrator of [[FALSE]].
