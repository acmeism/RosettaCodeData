{{Implementation|BASIC}}'''Aquarius BASIC''' refers to the more or less stripped-down releases of Microsoft BASIC for the Mattel/Radofin Aquarius.  The built-in ROM BASIC was seriously restricted since the system only included 4K of RAM and 8K of ROM by default. Minus the RAM used for video and system management, only about 1.7K or RAM were usable by default; the optionally available Extended Microsoft BASIC that came on ROM cartridge was somewhat more generous, and RAM expansion cartridges were available.
