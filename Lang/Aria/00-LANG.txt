Aria is a modern, dynamic scripting language. It is meant to be a “sweet spot” language, easy to pick-up and enjoyable to use.

It provides a familiar C-style syntax, with a feature set inspired by well-beloved languages such as Python and Rust. It comes with little ceremony and a focus on getting stuff done.

Aria programs are written as .aria files and passed to the Aria virtual machine, which compiles them down to bytecode and executes them.

The Aria interpreter is written in Rust, 2024 edition.
