AsciiDots is an esoteric programming language based on ascii art and electrical engineering. An AsciiDots program is a potentially complex track, which is traversed by one or more dots (the actual number varies as the code is executed). Each of these dots stores a single value, and may have an id. The program is executed in a series of steps, in which all dots moves one character forward, and may trigger operations depending on which character the dot lands. All dots are evaluated simultaneously, before the next step is executed.
