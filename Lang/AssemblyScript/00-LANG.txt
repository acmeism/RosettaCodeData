{{language|AssemblyScript}}

AssemblyScript compiles a strict subset of [http://www.typescriptlang.org/ Typescript] (basically JavaScript with types) to [https://webassembly.org/ WebAssembly] using [https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen Binaryen]. It generates lean and mean WebAssembly modules while being just an npm install away.
