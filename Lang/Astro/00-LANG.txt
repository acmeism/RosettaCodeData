{{stub}}{{language|Astro}}
Astro is a fun safe language for rapid prototyping and high performance applications. 
Astro provides a sophisticated compiler with full type inference, compile-time garbage collection, and an extensive mathematical function library. 
It pushes multiple dispatch as its primary paradigm but borrows from several other paradigms as well.
