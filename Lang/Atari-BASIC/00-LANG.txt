'''Atari BASIC''' refers to the BASIC that shipped with Atari 8-bit micros. Revision A was released on cartridge for early models like the Atari 400 and 800 (1979), while revision B was included in ROM on later models such as the 800XL (1983). (Revision A is considered superior because revision B has more bugs!) Revision C was released on cartridge to address the bugs introduced in revision B. It was also in ROM on later 800XL computers and the XE range.

Emulators for Atari 8-bit computers include:
*[https://atari800.github.io/ Atari800] (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)
*[https://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html Altirra] (Windows)

Downloading the original Atari ROMs is not necessary for Atari800 or Altirra because they include the open source Altirra ROMs, which also feature Altirra BASIC, a fully compatible replacement for Atari BASIC. Altirra BASIC and OS are also better optimized than the original Atari ROMs; especially FOR loops and floating point functions are much quicker.

To start Atari800 in BASIC mode, run it as <code>atari800 -basic</code>. Some important keys in Atari800 are F1=Settings, F5=Reset, F7=Break, F9=Quit, F10=Screenshot; see [https://github.com/atari800/atari800/blob/master/DOC/USAGE DOC/USAGE] for more. Lowercase characters in strings can be entered by first pressing Caps Lock in Atari800.

In Atari800, folders on the host computer can be mounted in ''Emulator Configuration ⇨ Host Device Settings'', so then you can e.g. use <code>LOAD "H1:MYPROG.BAS"</code> to load a program from local disk. By default, folders are mounted read-only.

BASIC programs in tokenized form are loaded and saved with LOAD and SAVE; in ASCII/ATASCII format you load them with ENTER and save them with LIST, e.g. <code>LIST “H1:PROGRAM.LST”</code>.

After 9 minutes of inactivity, a screen saver (called attract mode by Atari) will activate and cycle colors. This can be stopped by an occasional <code>POKE 77,0</code> to reset the timer.

Like in Palo Alto Tiny BASIC, commands can be abbreviated by their first (unique) letters and a period, e.g. <code>L.</code> for <code>LIST</code> or <code>GR.</code> for <code>GRAPHICS</code>.
