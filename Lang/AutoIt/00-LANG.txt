AutoIt is a freeware scripting language for Microsoft Windows with a [[BASIC]]-like Syntax. 

An AutoIt script can be compiled into a compressed, stand-alone executable which can be run on computers that do not have the AutoIt interpreter installed. A wide range of function libraries (known as UDF's, or "User Defined Functions") are also included as standard or are available from the website to add specialized functionality. AutoIt can also use Win32 DLL's and Libraries like OpenGL, DirectX or any third-party DLL API. This makes 3D Game Development as well as WinAPI Handling possible to use in AutoIt.
