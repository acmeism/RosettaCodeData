'''BBC BASIC''' is a version of the [[BASIC]] programming language. It is notable for being one of the few modern dialects that makes no attempt to be compatible to any great degree with [[Microsoft]] BASICs.

BBC BASIC was originally written for the [[wp:BBC Micro|BBC Microcomputer]] as part of the '''BBC Computer Literacy Project''' under the direction of the [[wp:BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (thus the name), but now runs on most modern, popular operating systems (and several older and/or less-popular ones).

Wikipedia has [[wp:BBC BASIC|an article about BBC BASIC]], but the best source of information is probably [http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html the BBC BASIC homepage].
