The '''BML''' programming language is a BASIC dialect currently being developed by Fluffy Smoke Technologies(formerly The BuRg3r Team) and some of its features are based on [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Lua Lua].

BML is also compiled into its own bytecode which can then either be executed or translated into a different language entirely.
