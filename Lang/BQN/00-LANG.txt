BQN is a new (initially released 2020) [[wp:Array programming|array oriented]], [[functional_programming|functional]] programming language in the [[APL]] lineage, which aims to remove irregular and burdensome aspects of the APL tradition and put the great ideas on a firmer footing. While its use demands a solid understanding of functions and multidimensional arrays, BQN's focus on providing simple, consistent, and powerful array operations (and documentation!) makes it a good language for learning array programming and building stronger array intuition.
