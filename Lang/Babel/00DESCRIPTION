{{alertbox|#ffffe0|''Were you looking for the [[Common Lisp]] library? That category has now been [[:Category:Babel (library)|renamed]].''}}
{{language}}Babel is an interpreted language designed by Clayton Bauman. It is an untyped, stack-based, postfix language with support for arrays, lists and hashes (dictionaries). Babel 1.0 will support built-in crypto-based verification of code in order to enable safer remote code execution.

Babel is implemented in [[C]]. It is still under development with a v0.9 release planned for December 2013, so please excuse the dust and debris in the [https://github.com/claytonkb/Babel current implementation].
