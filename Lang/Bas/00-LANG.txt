From [http://www.moria.de/~michael/bas/ the language's website]: ''Bas is an interpreter for the classic dialect of the programming language BASIC. It is pretty compatible to typical BASIC interpreters of the 1980s, unlike some other UNIX BASIC interpreters, that implement a different syntax, breaking compatibility to existing programs.'' You might find it compatible enough with BASIC interpreters of the late 1970s, as well, such as TRS-80 LEVEL II BASIC.
