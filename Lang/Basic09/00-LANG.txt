{{language|Basic09}}Basic09 is a dialect of BASIC created by Microware Systems Corporation in 1978 for use on the OS-9 operating system designed for the Motorola 6809 microporcessor. There is a version for OS-9/68000, "Microware BASIC", identical save that the INTEGER type is a four-byte signed integer instead of two-byte and REAL is IEEE 754 double precision rather than the five-byte format in the original version.
