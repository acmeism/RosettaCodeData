{{Implementation|BASIC}}
'''batari Basic''' is a version of the BASIC programming language used to program the Atari 2600. Unlike [[BASIC Programming]], an official cartridge released in 1979 which interprets code, the code is compiled, increasing the speed of execution and allowing it to be put on a cartridge. As the syntax is simpler, it is easier to write code in a shorter amount of time than the equivalent assembly language.

==History==
batari Basic was created by Fred X. Quimby, who introduced it on July 7, 2005, aiming for it to be used to make programming the Atari 2600 easier, with the idea users would move onto assembly language.<ref>[https://atariage.com/forums/topic/72428-atari-2600-basic-compiler-is-here/ Atari 2600 BASIC compiler is here!]</ref> These goals have since expanded, e.g. to attract more developers to develop homebrew, due to the ease of programming compared to the difficulty of assembly language, previously the only option.
