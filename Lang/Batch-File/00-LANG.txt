{{language|Batch File}}'''Batch files''' are the scripting languages for [[Microsoft]] command line shells, such as [[MS-DOS]], COMMAND.EXE, and CMD.EXE. They typically have either the .BAT or .CMD extension.

The "batch files" written in the Batch File language are not to be confused with the "bash scripts" written in the [[bash | bash programming language]] for the [[UNIX Shell]].
