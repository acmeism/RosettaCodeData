= Battlestar =

A different take on assembly, with the goal of creating tiny executables.

== Battlestar is ==

* A work in progress.
* Created for fun and for the educational process.
* A programming language specifically for 64-bit x86 Linux, 32-bit x86 Linux, 32-bit x86 OS X and 16-bit x86 DOS.
* Subset of assembly with different syntax and support for inline C.
* The indended purpose is for writing 4k and 64k demoscene demos.

== Features ==

* The resulting executables are tiny!
* "hello world" is only 129 bytes on 32-bit Linux (when using sstrip from elfkickers).
* It's possible to write an operating system with only one source file.
* Full support for inline C (by utilizing an external compiler like gcc or tcc).
* C and Battlestar code can exist in the same source file and calls can be made both ways.
* Battlestar programs compile almost instantly.
* Programs can be run like scripts by including this line at the top: #!/usr/bin/bts
* Interrupts can be called with the same syntax for both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 on Linux.
* Also supports 16-bit x86 with DosBox.
* The intermediate assembly is fully commented.
