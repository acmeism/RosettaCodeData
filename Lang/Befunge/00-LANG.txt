{{language|Befunge}}
'''Befunge''' is an esoteric programming language invented by Chris Pressey in 1993. It is unusual for having a two-dimensional toroidal code space. Commands are single characters, and the instruction pointer can move up, down, left, and right across the source. One of the original goals of the language was to be as hard to compile as possible.

In the latter part of the 90s, several attempts were made to extend the language, with mutually incompatible versions proposed in '96, '97 and '98. It was at this time that the idea of variant dimensions were introduced, with '''Unefunge''' (one-dimensional), '''Trefunge''' (three-dimensional) and '''Nefunge''' (''N''-dimensional) - the general language class then being refered to as a '''Funge'''.

The '96 and '97 versions are now largely considered abandoned, and while '''Funge-98''' did gain a certain amount of traction, it has never been as widely adopted as the original '''Befunge-93'''. Being considerably more complex than the original, it is often deemed "too complicated" and sometimes even "too normal".
