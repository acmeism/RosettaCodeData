[http://sam.ai.ki/brace/ Brace] is a dialect of [[C]] that looks like [[Python]]. It has coroutines, hygenic macros, header generation, #! scripting and cached executables, libraries with graphics and sound, and many animated demos.  It is a work in progress and most likely will not build on your system without some hacking, unless you are using Debian.  Please check out the web page and contact the developer sam@ai.ki if you are interested in having a look at brace, or helping with its development.
