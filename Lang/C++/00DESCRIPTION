'''C++''' is named after the [[derived from::compatible with::C]] language, from which it is derived. C++ extends C into an [[object-oriented language]]. However, unlike other object-oriented languages, it doesn't try to force you into [[object-oriented programming]], but is a multi-[[:Category:Programming Paradigms|paradigm]] language. Besides conventional [[procedural programming]] and object-oriented programming, it also supports [[generic programming]]. 

The ++ in C++ is some what of an inside joke, in that C++ is C with a Post Increment operator attached, thus C++ is C + 1; however, this interpretation has the flaw that post-increment increments the value ''after'' returning the value, so the post-increment expression still evaluates to the value before the increment.

If you can't find an implementation for your task in the C++ category below, please look in the [[C]] category, as many of the tasks can be implemented identically in C and C++.

==Versions==
* '''C++98''' is the version of C++ standardized by ISO in 1998. It is the most commonly used and supported version of the language. The term "C++" usually refers to C++98.
* '''C++03''' is a minor improvement to C++98, standardized by ISO in 2003.
* '''TR1''' (Technical Report 1) is a proposal for extensions to the C++ standard library. It was published in 2007. Many of its proposals made it into C++11. Many compilers support it, but put its headers in a different directory.
* '''C++11''' (formerly called '''C++0x''' and sometimes '''C++1x''') is a significant improvement, adding many new language features and libraries. It was standardized by ISO in 2011. Most of its features are available in [[GCC]] [http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html] and [[Clang]] [http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html].
* '''C++14''' (formerly called '''C++1y''') is a minor improvement to C++11, standardized by ISO in 2014. Most of its features are available in [[Clang]] [http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html] and [[GCC]] [http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx1y.html].
* '''C++17''' (or '''C++1z''') is informal name of future standard which will become in 2017, but many of its features are already published and supported by several compilers.
