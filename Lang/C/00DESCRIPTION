'''C''' is a general-purpose, [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[imperative programming|imperative]] computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at the [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] for use with the [[UNIX]] operating system. C evolved from its predecessor, [[derived from::B]].

C has since spread to many other [[:Category:Platforms|platforms]], and is now one of the most widely used programming languages. C has also greatly influenced many other popular languages, such as [[C++]] and [[Objective-C]], which were originally designed as enhancements to C. People are so familiar with its syntax that many other languages such as [[AWK]], [[PHP]], [[Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[D]], and [[C Sharp|C#]] deliberately used its "look and feel". C is the most commonly used programming language for writing system software, though it is also widely used for writing applications. [[C]] is the ''lingua franca'' of the [[open source]] community.

==Versions==
* '''K&R C''' was the first widely-used form of C. It was originally documented in ''The C Programming Language'', published in 1978. It is named for the authors, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (also the language's creator). Code in this style is virtually nonexistent today.
* '''C89''' (often called '''[[ANSI]] C''') is the version of C standardized by ANSI in 1989. It is the most commonly used and supported version of the language.
* '''C90''' (often called '''[[ISO]] C''') is identical to C89, republished by ISO in 1990. 
* '''C99''' is a significant improvement, adopting many features of [[C++]] and standardizing common compiler extensions. It was standardized by ISO in 1999, and by ANSI in 2000. It is primarily supported by commercial C compilers, but most of its features are available in [[Clang]] [[GCC]]. [http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html]
* '''C11''' is the current standard, published in December 2011. It is the default for [[GCC]] as of version 5.1.
