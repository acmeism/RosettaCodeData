'''C0H''' is a general-purpose, [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[imperative programming|imperative]] computer programming language, partially developed by Andr√© van Delft in 2011. It is a small extension to the well known [[derived from::compatible with::C]] programming language, allowing for the smallest "Hello World" program that one can think of.

The development of C0H has been inspired on the [[HQ9+]] programming language, which accepts "H" in its source to print "Hello World!". However, HQ9+ is not a general purpose programming language; in fact it has very limited capabilities. C0H improves over HQ9+ by offering the full power of the C language; moreover, C0H offers a shorter path to writing a Hello World program: just create an empty file!

C0H has been followed up by [[C1R]], a C extension aimed at short solutions for tasks that are implemented by C programs at RosettaCode.org.
==Versions==
* version 0.99 existed for about 35 minutes. An empty input source file would result in a program printing "Hello World!".
* version 1.00 quickly followed up version 0.99, after the creator of the language found out to his great surprise that the web site Rosetta Code required a "Hello World" program to print "Goodbye, World!"

==Implementation==
See [[C0H Implementation]]

==Documentation==
To get a reference document on C0H, it is advised to upgrade a reference document on the "C" programming language, and attach a Post-it note stating C0H is like C, except that an empty input file yields "Goodbye, World".
