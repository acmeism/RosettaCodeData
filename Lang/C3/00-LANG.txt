'''C3''' is a [[procedural programming|procedural]], imperative language evolved from [[C]], with minor changes to syntax and semantics. Among the changes are added modules, semantic macros, error handling and slices. There is no preprocessor.

The C3 name is a nod to the [[C2]] language which it was inspired by. It shares goals and some syntax with C2, and the original author of C3 also contributed to C2's source code.
