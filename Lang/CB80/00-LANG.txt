CB80 is not a separate language or dialect but rather a companion compiler for the [[CBASIC]] dialect of BASIC for 8-bit CP/M systems. The CBASIC compiler compiles source code into an intermediate form, which is stored on disk with the file extension INT. The compiled code is executed by invoking a run-time interpreter (CRUN.COM) from the command line. CB80, by contrast, compiles the source into a relocatable machine code file having an REL extension, which is then linked with necessary run-time library routines using the supplied linker (either LINK.COM or LK80.COM), to create a stand-alone executable file with the extension COM, which can be run simply by typing its name on the CP/M command-line. All of the posted CBASIC examples on Rosetta Code as of 9/14/2024 will compile and run without change under CB80. One subtle difference which could affect some programs lies in the behavior of the FOR .. NEXT statement. When run under CBASIC the body of the statement will always be executed at least once even if the index variable exceeds the value of the stop expression. If compiled using CB80, however, the loop will not be executed under those circumstances.
