{{stub}}{{language|Casio BASIC}}
'''[[:wp:Casio BASIC|Casio BASIC]]''' is the programming language used in Casio calculators. It is available on all Casio graphing calculators and several non-graphing models, despite some differences between versions. Casio BASIC is designed to be simple and easy to learn. Its major drawback is its slowness especially when using graphical functions. Casio BASIC is not affiliated with [[BASIC]] and is not as similar to it as the name would suggest. Casio BASIC is equivalent to [[TI-BASIC]] on TI calculators.
