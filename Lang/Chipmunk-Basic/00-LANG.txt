'''Chipmunk Basic''' is a [[:Category:BASIC|BASIC]] [[interpreter]] which runs on several different systems ([[Mac OS]] (from OS X back to System 6), [[Windows]], [[Linux]], [[wp:HP-UX|HP-UX]], and [[Solaris]]).

Chipmunk Basic is an old-fashioned Basic interpreter. Built-in editor based on line numbers allows to enter a program from the console keyboard; but Basic programs do not require line numbers when these programs are written with an external editor and run from files. Basic commands and statements can be entered and interpreted in immediate mode, or executed as program statements when a Basic program is run.
