Cilk++ is an extension to C++ that offers a quick, easy and reliable way to improve the performance of C++ programs on multi-core processors. 

It introduces three new key words:

* The cilk_spawn keyword modifies a function call statement to tell the Cilk++ runtime system that the function may (but is not required to) run in parallel with the caller

* The cilk_sync statement indicates that the current function cannot run in parallel with its spawned children. After the children all complete, the current function can continue.

* A cilk_for loop is a replacement for the normal C++ for loop that permits loop iterations to run in parallel. The Cilk++ compiler converts a cilk_for loop into an efficient divide-and-conquer recursive traversal over the loop iterations.
