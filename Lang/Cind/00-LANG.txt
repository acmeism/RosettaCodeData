Cind is a powerful programming language designed for concurrent programming. 

The language is quite advanced but semantics is very simple, 
in particular, this language has amazing semantics for thread management and developing concurrent algorithms. 
It also has many useful features, such as object-oriented model of code and functional programming syntax. 
And most importantly, programming is easier and it works faster than in most modern programming languages.
