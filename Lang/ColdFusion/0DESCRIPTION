|LCT=yes}}'''ColdFusion''' is an application server and software development framework used for the development of computer software in general, and dynamic web sites in particular. In this regard, ColdFusion is a similar product to [[Microsoft]] [[ASP|ASP.NET]] or [[Java|Java Enterprise Edition]].

The primary feature of ColdFusion is its associated scripting language, ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML), which compares to [[Java Server Pages|JSP]], [[C sharp|C#]], or [[PHP]] and resembles [[HTML]] in syntax. "ColdFusion" is often used synonymously with "CFML", but it should be noted that there are additional CFML application servers besides ColdFusion, and that ColdFusion supports programming languages other than CFML, such as server-side [[ActionScript]].
