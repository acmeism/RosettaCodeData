[[wp:COMAL|COMAL]] (Common Algorithmic Language) is a structured language derived from [[Basic]] with inspiration from [[Pascal]] by Benedict Løfstedt and Børge R. Christensen in Denmark in 1973. Its aim was to replace Basic as an educational language, keeping its basic syntax while introducing support for proper structured programming. Its first implementations were built upon extended Basic interpreters, with a formalised specification realised in COMAL 80. 

Later implementations have added turtle graphics and object orientation, but these additions have never been standardised. Comal implementations are available for most popular home computers and operating systems.
