'''Comefrom0x10''' (pronounced "come from sixteen" and abbreviated "cf0x10") is a high-level language that has only one control flow statement: <code>comefrom</code>. Several other languages support comefrom statements and some, like Cf0x10, support no other control flow statements. Cf0x10 is unique in that it is higher level than others of this nature.

Comefrom0x10 features lexical scope, based on block-level indentation, named identifiers and other hallmarks of structured programming.
