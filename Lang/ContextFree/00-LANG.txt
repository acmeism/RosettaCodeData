{{stub}}{{language|ContextFree}}
Context Free is a lovely little language for creating pretty pictures from shape rules, conceptually similar to a Logo/Turtle based language.

Although called Context Free, (somewhat ironically), it's helpful to think of an implicit turtle like context that determines the current position, size, color, etc... of shapes.

However, don't judge the quality of the language by the programmer art here - instead view some of the mind-blowing examples on the Context Free Art gallery: [https://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/]
