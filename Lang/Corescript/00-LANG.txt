{{language}}

Corescript is a simple programming language inspired  
by Windows Batch, JS, and MIT's Scratch.

The main idea was to work with `print Hello World`. No  
parenthesis, just like Batch.

All the Corescript interpreters/compilers are
available here as open-source:

== The Language ==
The initial version, Corescript 0, has a very bare bones syntax,  
yet is very simple and easy to learn.

Here is a link to an example program:

The first version, implemented in May 2017, leaned toward Scratch's
design.

The first version was implemented in Javascript as an online tool,
but later versions were also implemented in C#, Go, and C.

The new JS version has been released and can be used here:
