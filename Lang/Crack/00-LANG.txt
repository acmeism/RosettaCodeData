Crack aims to provide the ease of development of a scripting language with the performance of a compiled language. The crack language itself derives concepts from [[C++]], [[Java]] and [[Python]], incorporating [[object-oriented programming]], operator overloading and strong typing.

The "crack" program is a "script executor" that compiles source to machine code [[JIT|on the fly]] (it will cache the code to intermediate formats as appropriate). A static (ahead of time) compiler is also in development.
