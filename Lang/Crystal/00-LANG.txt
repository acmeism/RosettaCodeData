Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:
* Have the same syntax as Ruby, or at least as similar as possible.
* Never have to specify the type of a variable or method argument.
* Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
* Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
* Compile to efficient native code.
