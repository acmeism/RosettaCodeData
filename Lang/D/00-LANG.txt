'''D''' is an [[object-oriented]], [[imperative programming|imperative]], functional and multi-[[:Category:Programming Paradigms|paradigm]] systems programming language designed by Walter Bright of Digital Mars. 
Although it originated as a re-engineering of [[C++]], and is thus predominantly influenced by that language, it is not a variant of C++. 
Rather, D redesigns some C++ features and is influenced by concepts from other programming languages such as [[Python]], [[Java]], [[C sharp|C#]] and [[Eiffel]].
