DCL, the DIGITAL Command Language, is the standard command language adopted by most of the operating systems that were sold by the former Digital Equipment Corporation (which has since been acquired by Compaq which itself was acquired by Hewlett-Packard). It had its roots in the IAS, TOPS-20, and RT-11 operating systems and was implemented as a standard across most of Digital's operating systems, notably RSX-11, but took its most powerful form in the OpenVMS operating system.

Written when the Fortran programming language was in heavy use, DCL is a scripting language supporting several datatypes, including strings, integers, bit arrays, arrays and booleans, but not floating point numbers. Access to OpenVMS system services (kernel API) is through lexical functions, which perform the same as their compiled language counterparts and allow scripts to get information on system state. DCL includes IF-THEN-ELSE, access to all the RMS file types including stream, indexed, and sequential, but unfortunately lacks a DO-WHILE or other looping construct, requiring users to make do with IF and GOTO-label statements instead.
