DigitalMicrograph Script is a language supported by the [http://www.gatan.com Gatan] DigitalMicrograph (DM) application. [http://www.gatan.com/resources/scripting/demo/index.php DigitalMicrograph] was developed in the early 1990's to provide an environment in which Gatan's customers could control hardware and interact with applications developed to exploit this hardware. Through DMS customers can easily interact with images and hardware to create their own applications.

DMS resembles C/C++ and is partly interpreted and partly compiled. Single line expressions that manipulate image data are compiled for speed.
