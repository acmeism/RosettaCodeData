'''DUP''' is a [[Forth]]-like esoteric programming language invented by Ian Osgood. DUP is a variant/enhancement of Wouter van Oortmerssen’s FALSE language.

Changes from FALSE include:

* Change of operators: DIV (integer division) changed to Forth-like MOD/DIV, new OVER operator etc.
* String output changed to string definition. Output has to be handled separately.
* Return stack is fully accessible and can be manipulated.
* Operator definition and override is possible. Access to full Unicode array of symbols for operator names.
