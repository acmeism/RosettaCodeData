'''Dafny''' is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It includes built-in specification constructs which can be used to verify the functional correctness of programs.

The Dafny programming language is designed to support the static verification of programs. It is imperative, sequential, supports generic classes, dynamic allocation, and inductive datatypes, and builds in specification constructs. The specifications include pre- and postconditions, invariants, frame specifications (read and write sets), and termination metrics.
