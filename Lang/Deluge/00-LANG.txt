Deluge (or ''Data Enriched Language for the Universal Grid Environment'') is an online scripting language integrated with [http://creator.zoho.com Zoho Creator]. It enables users of Zoho to add logic to the application in order to extend it. The entire database layer is abstracted; a user will only speak in terms of forms and fields when scripting in Deluge.

For more information, read the Zoho [https://help.creator.zoho.com/Deluge-Reference---Overview.html Deluge information page].

For a main page of where and how one can use the language, see [https://help.creator.zoho.com/Deluge-Reference.html here].
