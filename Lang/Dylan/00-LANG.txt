Dylan is an [[:Category:Programming paradigm/Imperative|imperative]], [[:Category:Programming paradigm/Functional|functional]] programming language highly inspired by various [[Lisp]]s. Although original prototypes kept Lisp's s-expr based syntax, modern Dylan is written in a somewhat [[Pascal]]/[[C]]-inspired syntax. It's object system is notable for being CLOS-style (oriented around generic methods) rather than [[Smalltalk]] message-passing style. It allows for a mix of static and dynamic typing.
