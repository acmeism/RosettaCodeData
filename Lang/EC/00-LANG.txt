eC (Ecere C) is an [[object-oriented]] language derived from and compatible with [[derived from::compatible with::C]] designed and developed by Ecere Corporation. It aims at being fast, light and easy to write.

It is supported by a cross-[[platform]] runtime [[Ecere|library]] including its own [[GUI]] toolkit, 2D/3D graphics engine as well as networking support.

The Ecere SDK is completely free and includes a full-featured [[Ecere IDE|Integrated Development Environment]] as well as a compiling tools for the eC language.

''Some of eC Features''

* Full C compatibility (Only exception: few additional reserved keywords such as 'class')
* Object-oriented class definitions supporting single inheritance
* Per instance virtual methods
* Import feature removing the need for header files
* Properties
* Automatic conversions
* Context sensitive enumerations
* Component object model enabling dynamic lookup of classes, methods, objects serialization and broking, runtime code class aggregation

''Properties & Conversions in eC''

 '''class''' Pen
 {
    Color color;
    '''public''' '''property''' Color color
    {
       '''get''' { '''return''' color; }
       '''set''' { color = value; }
    }
 }
 
 // Example Usage
 Pen pen { red };
 Pen pen { color = red };
 pen.color = ~pen.color; 
 pen.color += 10;
 pen.color.r = 255;
 pen.color = 0xFF0000;
 pen.color = { 255, 0, 0 };
 pen.color = ColorHSV { 0, 100, 100 };
 pen.color = ColorLab { 53, 79, 66 };
 pen.color = ColorCMYK { 0, 100, 100, 0 };
