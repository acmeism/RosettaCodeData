The Enterprise Control Language (ECL) is an advanced programming language supporting both query and ETL
(Extract, Transform, and Load) operations. ECL is designed and used with HPCC Systems(r). <ref name="LexisNexis Announces HPCC Systems, an Open Source Platform to Solve Big Data Problems">http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/newsevents/press-release.aspx?Id=1308140007126875</ref> It is specifically designed for data management and query processing. ECL code is written using the ECL IDE programming development tool. ECL is compiled into optimized C++ which is then compiled into DLLs for execution on the Thor and Roxie platforms. ECL can include inline C++ code encapsulated in functions. External services can be written in any language and compiled into shared libraries of functions callable from ECL. A pipe interface allows execution of external programs written in any language to be incorporated into jobs. ECL's design allows the leverage of created code for re-use in subsequent queries, the language extends itself as it is used. <ref name="ECL Programmers Guide">http://hpccsystems.com/download/docs/programmers-guide</ref><ref name="ECL Language Reference">http://hpccsystems.com/download/docs/ecl-language-reference</ref>
