''Easylang'' is a (beginners) programming language with built-in commands for graphics output. The statically typed language has a reduced syntax and semantics. Variables do not have to be declared, the data type is encoded in the variable name - as was usual in the earlier home computer BASIC. The data types are strings and numbers (floating point), arrays of strings and numbers, and arrays of arrays. Arrays are 1-based and can grow. Programs compiled into an AST tree run in the browser or in the browser IDE. 

[https://easylang.dev/ide/ A browser IDE] with different tutorials, one for beginners, makes programming and learning to program as easy as possible. 

The finished programs can be easily integrated into a [https://easylang.online/apps/ website].
