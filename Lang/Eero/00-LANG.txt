'''Eero''' is an [[object-oriented]] dialect of the [[derived from::compatible with::Objective-C]] language. 

It is fully header- and binary-compatible with standard Objective-C, and is implemented with a modified version of the Apple-sponsored LLVM/clang open-source compiler.

It features a streamlined syntax, Python-like indentation, universal dot notation, local type inference, limited operator overloading, and other features to improve readability and code safety. It was inspired by languages such as Smalltalk, Python, and Ruby.
