efene is a programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine.

The idea is to provide an alternative syntax to Erlang that is most suitable for people coming from languages like Java, C, C++, C#, or JavaScript.

The language is almost 100% compatible with Erlang (and will be); the compiler allows to translate an efene source file into a readable Erlang one. It also adds some syntactic sugar in some places to make some tasks easier.
