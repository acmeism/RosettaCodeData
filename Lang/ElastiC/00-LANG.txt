elastiC is a portable high-level object-oriented interpreted language with a [[C]]-like syntax. Its main characteristics are:
*Open Source, freely available, even for commercial purposes.
*Interpreted.
*Portable [[bytecode]] compilation.
*Familiar C-like syntax.
*Dynamic typing.
*Automatic real, very fast, Garbage Collection.
*Object Oriented with meta-programming support (a la [[Smalltalk]]).
*Functional programming support (Scheme like closures with lexical scoping, and eval-like functionality).
*Hierarchical Namespaces.
*Rich set of useful built-in types (dynamic arrays, dictionaries, symbols, ...).
*Extensibile with C (you can add functions, types, classes, methods, packages, ...).
*Embeddable in C.
*Small footprint, making it ideal also in embedded systems.


elastiC has been strongly influenced by C, Smalltalk, [[Scheme]] and [[Python]] and tries to merge the best characteristics of all these languages, while still coherently maintaining its unique personality.
