'''Elm''' is a programming language for developing browser-based applications and graphical user interfaces that strictly adheres to the functional paradigm. This means that Elm does not rely on mutability or destructive updates.

In order to run web applications, Elm compiles to Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The Functional model-view-update architecture is used in lieu of event handlers and callbacks. For right markup, Elm allows to embed Markdown directly in the language.

Elm's syntax closely resembles that of Haskell while influenced by OCaml, FSharp, and Javascript. Unlike Haskell, Elm's "has type" operator is written with a single colon and borrows the application operators (<|) and (|>) from FSharp. From Javascript, Elm borrows the idea of JSON-like objects which it turns into records. These are type-safe objects whose fields are accessible with a (.) operator. This means that records in Elm have the flexibility of Javascript objects minus their unpredictable dynamism.
