{{stub}}{{language|Epoxy}}

Epoxy is a interpreted, high-level, structured, dynamically typed programming language written in JavaScript which has a similar syntax design to lua; it has very simplistic syntax, and was designed to take a step away from c-style & js-style languages.

Epoxy is the first language created by FIREYAUTO to have a fully sandboxed environment from its parent language due to the nature of how the closures in the language work. This means that only functions specifically designed for the language will work, and there is a barrier from parent operations to the language operations to follow its own set of rules for logical operations and more. Because of the asynchronous nature of the interpreter for Epoxy, yielding code is very simple in the language.

Epoxy is considerably slow in the grand scheme of a programming language, but this is mainly due to the abstraction to make Epoxy easier to develop and maintain. In the future there may be tests to design compilers which could enhance the performance of Epoxy.

== Code Examples ==

=== Functions ===

<lang epoxy>fn Add(...Numbers) --This function will compute the sum of all provided numbers
	var Sum: 0
	iter Number of Numbers do
		Sum+: Number
	cls
	return Sum
cls

log(Add(1,2,3)) --6</lang>

=== Loops ===

<lang epoxy>loop i:1; i<=10; i+:1 do
	if i==3 then
		continue
	cls
	log(i)
cls</lang>

<lang epoxy>var List: [1,2,3,4]

iter Value of List do
	log(Value*2)
cls</lang>
