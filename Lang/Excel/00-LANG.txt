[[wp:Microsoft_Excel|Excel]] is a [[wp:Spreadsheet|spreadsheet]] program from [[wp:Microsoft_Office|Microsoft Office]] suite applications. Excel provides calculations, [[wp:Spreadsheet#Cell_reference|cell referencing]], and illustration of data sheets by using its ''functions'', ''formulas'', ''graphs'', etc. 


The Excel formula language consists of several hundred pure functions, and only constitutes a Turing-complete programming language in recent builds (Office 365 beta, [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-lambda-turn-excel-formulas-into-custom-functions/ba-p/1925546 since Dec 2020]) which have introduced a LAMBDA function, and the ability to bind names to reusable custom functions in the Excel Name Manager.

The Excel formula language, for all its limitations, is arguably the most widely used programming language in the world. 

Estimates of the number of users are typically in the region of 750 million.
