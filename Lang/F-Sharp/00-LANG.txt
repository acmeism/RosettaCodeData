'''F#''' is a multi-paradigm ([[functional programming|functional]] and [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]]), strongly typed language created by Don Syme at Microsoft Research for Microsoft's [[.NET]] platform.
It is based on the [[Caml]] language, and resembles it in syntax.

F# is included as an 'official' .NET language in [[Visual Studio]] 2010 and later.
