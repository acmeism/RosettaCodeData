{{language|FALSE
|site=http://strlen.com/false-language}}
'''FALSE''' is a [[Forth]]-like esoteric programming language invented by Wouter van Oortmerssen in 1993, originally written for the Amiga to see how small one could make a compiler (1K) for a language that was still powerful enough to write applications. FALSE directly inspired the creation of [[Brainf***]] and [[Befunge]].
