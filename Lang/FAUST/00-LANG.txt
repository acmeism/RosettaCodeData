FAUST is a compiled language for real-time audio signal processing.

The name FAUST stands for Functional AUdio STream. Its programming model combines two approaches : functional programming and block diagram composition. You can think of FAUST as a structured block diagram language with a textual syntax. 

FAUST is intended for developers who need to develop efficient C/C++ audio plugins for existing systems or full standalone audio applications. Thanks to some specific compilation techniques and powerful optimizations, the [[C++]] code generated by the Faust compiler is usually very fast. It can generally compete with (and sometimes outperform) hand-written [[C]] code.
