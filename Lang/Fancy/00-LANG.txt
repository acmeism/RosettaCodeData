{{language programming paradigm|object-oriented}}

Fancy is a new (pure) [[object-oriented]] programming language that tries to meet the following goals:

* Be reasonably fast
* Be a dynamic language (as in [[Smalltalk]] or [[Ruby]])
* Be truly object oriented (as in Smalltalk or Ruby)
* Be concurrent (via the Actor Model)
* Be easy to understand
* Be portable and possibly run on multiple runtimes (this isn’t the case yet)

At the moment, Fancy follows most of the goals above. Its current implementation is an interpreter written in [[implemented in language::C++]].
