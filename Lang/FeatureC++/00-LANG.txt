FeatureC++ is a [[C++]] language extension to support Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP). FOP is the study of feature modularity in program families. FeatureC++ enables a programmer to express features in a modular way. It supports easy derivation and composition of program family members based on declarative specifications in form of algebraic equations. FeatureC++ also adopts language concepts of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to further increase modularity of cross-cutting concerns. Currently, it supports Aspectual Mixin Layers (AML). AML combine the advantages of Mixins and Aspects to increase the crosscutting modularity.
FeatureC++ comes in form of a [[C++]] preprocesser that transforms FeatureC++ code into native C++ code.
