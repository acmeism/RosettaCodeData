{{language|Fennel}}

According to Fennel website: Fennel is a programming language that brings together the speed, simplicity, and reach of Lua with the flexibility of a lisp syntax and macro system.
<ul>
  <li>Full Lua compatibility: Easily call any Lua function or library from Fennel and vice-versa.</li>
  <li>Zero overhead: Compiled code should be just as or more efficient than hand-written Lua.</li>
  <li>Compile-time macros: Ship compiled code with no runtime dependency on Fennel.</li>
  <li>Embeddable: Fennel is a one-file library as well as an executable. Embed it in other programs to support runtime extensibility and interactive development.</li>
</ul>

Anywhere you can run Lua code, you can run Fennel code.
