Frink is a programming language designed and implemented by Alan Eliasen.  It is designed to be a general-purpose, multi-paradigm language.

One of the most obvious differentiating features of Frink is that it tracks units of measure (feet, meters, tons, watts, etc.) through all calculations, helping ensure that physical calculations make sense.  Frink understands how different units of measure interrelate, such as a length cubed is a volume, or power multiplied by time is energy.  Different units of measure can be mixed in calculations, and Frink automatically ensures that the calculations lead to a result with the expected dimensions.  It attempts to follow standard mathematical notation as closely as possible, and makes a strong effort to do the right thing with numeric types.

Frink runs on the JVM and on Android, and is available in the Android Market.
