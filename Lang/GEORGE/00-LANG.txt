GEORGE is a high-level language invented by Charles Leonard Hamblin in 1957.

It makes use of a push-down pop-up Accumulator.
Operations are presented in Reverse Polish notation.
A monadic arithmetic operation is performed on the top element of the Accumulator.
Diadic operations are performed using the top two elements of the Accumulator.
The two values are removed (popped) and the result is placed on the top
of the Accumulator.
A Read [R] takes a value from the input, while a Print [P] prints the value
at the top of the Accumulator.
To explicitly remove (delete) the top of the accumulator, use a semicolon [;].
