Gambas is a free development environment based on a [[Basic]] interpreter with object extensions, a bit like Visual Basicâ„¢ (but it is NOT a clone !).

With Gambas, you can quickly design your program [[GUI]] with QT or GTK+, access [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], Firebird, ODBC and [[SQLite]] databases, pilot KDE applications with DCOP, translate your program into any language, create network applications easily, make 3D [[OpenGL]] applications, make CGI web applications, and so on...
