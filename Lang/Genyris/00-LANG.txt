{{language|Genyris
|site=http://sourceforge.net/projects/genyris/}}
A language inspired by the Semantic Web. Based on [[Scheme]], different because 
* Objects may be members of multiple classes 
* Classes are assigned and re-assigned to objects _after_ construction 
* Indentation syntax reduces parentheses.
