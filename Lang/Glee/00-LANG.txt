}}
Glee is an experimental array programming language that attempts to deliver stronger string/text manipulation capabilities than those currently offered in languages such as [[APL]], [[J]], and [[K]], while maintaining their capabilities at manipulating numeric data. 

Glee is targeted at applications where scripting languages such as [[Perl]] and [[Python]] are currently the first choice. The designer of Glee expects that it will be able to carve a niche for itself thanks to Glee's vector processing capabilities, as all the competitors are scalar language.[[#Citation|[1]]]
