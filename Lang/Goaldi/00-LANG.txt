From the website: ''Goaldi is a ... general-purpose programming language that combines the goal-directed evaluation model of the [[Icon]] language with modern features such as concurrency, objects, closures, and Unicode support. While Goaldi will look familiar to Icon programmers, it is not upwards compatible.''

''We’re pleased with how Goaldi has turned out. At this time the implementation is reasonably stable and robust, and we’re not actively developing it further.''

The Goaldi compiler is written in Goaldi. It produces intermediate code that is run on an interpreter written in Go. A copy of the intermediate code of the Goaldi compiler is provided, so you can bootstrap the compiler.
