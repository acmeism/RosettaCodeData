'''Gosu''' is a statically-typed [[runs on vm::JVM]]-based general purpose programming language that is designed to be expressive, easy-to-read, and high performing.  Gosu is uniquely both a high-functioning general purpose language as well as a powerful and concise scripting language.  In addition Gosu's type system defines an open API for domain-specific *types* as opposed to grammar e.g., XSD/XML is type-safe and modeled directly from XML schema files, without intermediate code generation.  Gosu began in 2002 from [http://guidewire.com/ Guidewire Software] as an internal language and was released in 2010 to the opensource world.  Scott McKinney is the creator and principle developer of the language.
