[[Category:WebAssembly]]
Grain is a new language that compiles to [[WebAssembly]] using [https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen Binaryen].
It aims to bring functionality common in academic and functional languages into the hands of a modern programmer, whilst also feeling largely familiar and homely. Due to its compilation to WebAssembly, it can run anywhere a WebAssembly runtime can run including in the browser, on your computer, and on a server.
