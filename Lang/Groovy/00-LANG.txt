'''Groovy''' is an [[object-oriented]] programming language for the [[Java]] platform as an alternative to the Java programming language. It can be viewed as a scripting language for the Java platform, as it has features similar to those of [[Python]], [[Ruby]], [[Perl]], and [[Smalltalk]]. In some contexts, the name JSR 241 is used as an alternate identifier for Groovy. Since 11/2015 Groovy is a top level Apache project.

'''Groovy''' ...
* is an agile and dynamic language for the [[Java Virtual Machine]]
* builds upon the strengths of Java but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk
* makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve
* supports Domain Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your code becomes easy to read and maintain
* makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL
* increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code when developing web, [[GUI]], database, or console applications
* simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box
* seamlessly integrates with all existing Java objects and libraries
* compiles straight to Java [[bytecode]] so you can use it anywhere you can use Java
