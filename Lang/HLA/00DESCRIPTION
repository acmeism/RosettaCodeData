High Level Assembler (HLA) is a front-end for several x86 assemblers developed by Randall Hyde. It allows the use of higher-level language constructs to aid both beginners and advanced assembly developers. It fully supports advanced data types and object-oriented assembly language programming. It uses a syntax loosely based on several high-level languages (HLL), such as Pascal, Ada, Modula-2, and C++, to allow the creation of readable assembly language programs, and to allow HLL programmers to learn HLA as rapidly as possible.
