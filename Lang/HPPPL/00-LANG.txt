The '''HP Prime Programming Language''' ('''HPPPL''' for short, and also known as '''HPPL''' or '''HP BASIC''') is the onboard calculator programming language for the [[wp:HP Prime|HP Prime]] graphing calculator. It is quite sophisticated for a calculator language; it is compiled directly before running, unlike interpreted languages such as [[TI-BASIC]] or [[RPL]]. It contains functions for advanced screen manipulation, altering the HP Prime file system, and (of course), a large mathematical library. It also allows you to leverage all the commands provided with the [[wp:Xcas|xCas]] algebra system available on the calculator.

The language is slower than most compiled languages because of how it integrates with the existing calculator abstractions, but it is still relatively speedy to both compile and execute. Its combination of speed and CAS integration makes it very suitable for on-the-fly mathematical computation.

A note on the name for this language: HP itself provides no set name for the language. The names above are what the language is usually referred to.
