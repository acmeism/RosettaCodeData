'''Haskell''' is a standardized purely [[functional programming]] language with non-strict semantics, named after the logician Haskell Curry. 
It is one of the more popular functional languages, and the [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] functional language on which the most research is being performed.

Although Haskell has a comparatively small user community, its strengths have been well applied to a few projects. 
Audrey Tang's Pugs is an implementation for the forthcoming [[Perl 6]] language with an [[interpreter]] and [[compiler|compilers]] that proved useful already after just a few months of its writing. 
Darcs is a revision control system, with several innovative features. 
Linspire GNU/[[Linux]] chose Haskell for system tools development.
