Icon is a descendant of [[SNOBOL4]] incorporating similar excellent string processing capabilities, built-in hash tables, success/failure based controls, dynamic storage, automatic type casting and coercion of values.  Icon added more conventional procedural syntax, generator expressions, goal-directed evaluation that automatically searches for successful results.  String scanning and matching superseded the pattern matching functionality of SNOBOL4.

Several extensions of Icon were developed to improve functionality.  Many of these were unified with [[Unicon]]
