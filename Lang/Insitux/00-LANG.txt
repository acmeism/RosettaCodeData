Insitux (pronounced /ɪnˈsɪtjuːɪks/) is a dynamically-typed functional scripting language inspired by Clojure, originally commissioned in July 2021 for safe and extensible in-game scripting in a popular Roblox game. It now targets Node.js/Bun and client-side web.

Despite its origins it is a capable language, with development focusing on the language itself, its Node.js ecosystem, and to a lesser extent its web ecosystem. This primarily involves adding to the already 200+ built-in operations, which tend to cause existing Insitux programs to shrink in size over time; and improving language performance since dropping Roblox compatibility in 2024.
