'''JSE''' (Jay's Scripting Engine) is a programming language, developed by Jayenkai (James Gamble) and released on February 21st 2021 as a mostly functional product. Its syntax is similar to Blitz [[BASIC]].

==History==
Jayenkai came up with the idea of writing a programming language when he was coming up with a minigame idea and wanted to avoid writing the game in JavaScript, as it would use a large amount of code for little gameplay. He tried Godot Online, but disliked it, as it was not as simple as copying and pasting and running code.
