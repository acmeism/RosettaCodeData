{{language|Janet}}

Janet is a lisp dialect meant for small systems and embedded usage.
There is no regexp built into the language, instead there is PEG, Parsing expression grammar.

From the website [https://janet-lang.org https://janet-lang.org]

Janet is a functional and imperative programming language. It runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, BSDs, and should run on other systems with some porting. The entire language (core library, interpreter, compiler, assembler, PEG) is less than 1MB. You can also add Janet scripting to an application by embedding a single C source file and a single header.
