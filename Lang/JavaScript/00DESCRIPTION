'''JavaScript''' is the name of Netscape Communications Corporation's implementation of the [[ECMAScript standard]], a scripting language based on the concept of prototype-based programming. The language is best known for its use in websites (as client-side JavaScript), but is also used to enable scripting access to objects embedded in other applications.

Despite the name, JavaScript is only distantly related to the [[Java]] programming language, the main similarity being their common debt to the [[C]] syntax. Semantically, JavaScript syntax has far more in common with the [[Self]] [[programming language]].

JavaScript is a registered trademark of [[Sun Microsystems]], Inc. It was used under license for technology invented and implemented by Netscape Communications and current entities such as the Mozilla Foundation.

Major browsers have generally implemented the features of ECMASScript 5 (ES5), and have started to adopt elements of ES6. 
Updates to implementation of ES6 features are tabulated here: [https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/ https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/]

Once largely confined to browser environments, and typically isolated from access to system resources, JavaScript (and particularly the cross-platform [https://nodejs.org/en/ Node.js runtime environment]) is now very widely used in server-side and application scripting environments, with full access to local file systems and other OS resources.

At the same time, mainly because of JavaScript's role in the web, there is a growing number of other languages which [https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js compile to JavaScript].
