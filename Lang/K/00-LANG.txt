K is a proprietary [[wp:Array_programming|array processing language]] developed by Arthur Whitney and commercialized by Kx Systems. The language serves as the foundation for kdb, an in-memory, column-based database, and other related financial products. The language, originally developed in 1993, is a variant of [[APL]] and contains elements of [[Scheme]]. Advocates of the language emphasize its speed, facility in handling arrays and its expressive syntax.[[#Citations|[1]]]

There are many dialects of K named after the versions of K produced by Whitney while working at various companies. K1 and K2 are no longer available. K3, K4, K5 and K6 have been implemented as open-source by various people. K7 has been publicly documented. The current language level under development by Whitney is K9, with its implementation named [[shakti]].
