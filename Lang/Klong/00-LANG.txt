Klong is an array language, like [[K]], but without the ambiguity. If you know K or [[APL]], you may be disappointed by Klong. If you don't know any array languages, it might explode your brain. Use at your own risk!

A Klong program is a set of functions that use powerful operators to manipulate lists (vectors) and (multi-dimensional) arrays. 

Note that Klong is a mathematical notation rather than a programming language. If you try to use it like your favorite OO/functional/procedural programming language, you will only get frustrated.
