Komodo is a programming language to test ideas in a fast and easy way. It is ideal for problems with basic discrete structures, like numbers and words. Komodo tries to make operating with these entities as easy as possible while minimizing the amount of code needed to achieve a successful implementation. Komodo is a scripting language regarding its flexibility, but it is a pretty specific language with a lot of assumptions about how things should be. Komodo is an experimental language, and some of its features are there because I had a personal preference for them.
