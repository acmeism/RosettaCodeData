'''KonsolScript''' is a cross-platform scripting language available under Windows and GNU/Linux.  It was intentionally developed on 2005 as the scripting language in writing games with KAGE (Alternative Game Engine) but its interpreter, Quixie, can also be used as common gateway interface for serving web pages.

Language design is greatly inspired by C programming language. Together with KAGE, KonsolScript was distributed as freeware until it was released as free software in SourceForge on April 2006. KonsolScript is licensed under GNU General Public License.
