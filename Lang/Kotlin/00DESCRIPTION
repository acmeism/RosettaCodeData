|site=http://kotlinlang.org}}Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the [[JVM]] and can also be compiled to JavaScript. It is being developed by JetBrains with assistance from open source contributors and is intended for industrial use.


In addition, a separate team at JetBrains is developing a version of Kotlin which compiles (via LLVM) directly to machine code for various platforms. The first Technology Preview for this version was rolled out in April 2017.

Kotlin has become a popular language for developing Android applications and, in May 2017, Google announced official support for it alongside Java and C++.
