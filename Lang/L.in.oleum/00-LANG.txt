L.in.oleum is an unstructured, untyped, procedural programming language. And more specifically, it's a form of cross-platform assembly language. It is oriented to the developement of general-purpose applications, especially when 100% portability, execution speed and module compactness is requested. This language has an almost 1:1 source-to-CPU instruction ratio, allows direct access to five general-purpose registers (performing basic operations from a theoretical 2 up to a pratical of even 10 times faster than memory-held variables), and if used well, is averagely twice as fast as C in pure computational power. Those who are familiar with Java, could imagine L.in.oleum to be based on similar concepts of hardware abstraction, but from a low-level standpoint. Other important highlights concern the inner coherence, clarity and simplicity of its syntax. The (admittedly cryptic) acronym stands for Low-level INterfaced OverLanguage for Extremely Universal Machine-coding, but nevermind it and just friendly call it Lino, like many do...
