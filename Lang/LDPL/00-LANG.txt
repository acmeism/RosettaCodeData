'''LDPL''', an acronym for 'Lartu's Definitive Programming Language' is a programming language created in 2019, designed from the ground up to be excessively expressive, fast, readable and easy to learn. It mimics English in the likeness of older languages like [[COBOL]]. It's highly portable and runs on a plethora of different architectures and operating systems including AMD-64, ARMv8 and PowerPC Linux and Mac OS X. It is primarily an imperative, structured language. It even supports UTF-8 out of the box.
