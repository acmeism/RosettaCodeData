Langur is an open-source imperative/functional programming language. The name langur begins with a lowercase letter when it does not start a sentence.

Langur code can be run with script files or with its REPL. The recommended file name extension is .langur.

Langur uses a hash mark for single line comments. Therefore, script files may begin with a shebang to tell a Linux shell where to find the interpreter.

Source code is in UTF-8, with no BOM, using Linux line returns (line feed) only.
