Latitude is a prototype-oriented dynamically-typed programming language which supports continuations and first-class scoping objects. Latitude is primarily designed with runtime reflection in mind, allowing the programmer to control the language itself at runtime.

* Object orientation through prototypes
* First-class scopes
* Automatic garbage collection
* Full continuation support via callCC
