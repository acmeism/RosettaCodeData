Lhogho is one of the hundreds implementations of the Logo language. However, unlike most other Logos, Lhogho is a compiler.

We wanted a name which sounds like Logo, but is written in a way which noone else has ever seen before. We did search "Lhogho" in the major search machines (back in 2005) and we got 0 hits.

Lhogho is developed by an independent team. The team leader is Assoc. Prof. Pavel Boytchev, PhD, Sofia University, Bulgaria. As an open source project we expect that other professionals will join us.
