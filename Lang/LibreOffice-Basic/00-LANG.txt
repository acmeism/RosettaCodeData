The LibreOffice Basic (once called OpenOffice.org Basic) programming language has been developed especially for LibreOffice and is firmly integrated in the LibreOffice package. 

As the name suggests, OpenOffice.org Basic is a programming language from the Basic family. Anyone who has previously worked with other Basic languages — in particular with Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from Microsoft — will quickly become accustomed to LibreOffice Basic. Large sections of the basic constructs of LibreOffice Basic are compatible with Visual Basic.
