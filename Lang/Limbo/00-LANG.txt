Limbo is the application programming language for Inferno. Syntactically similar to [[C]], and more so its predecessor, [[Go]], it has several features that make it simpler, safer and yet more powerful and better suited to the development of concurrent, distributed systems. The Limbo compiler generates architecture independent object code which is then interpreted by the Dis Virtual Machine or compiled just before runtime to improve performance. This ensures that Limbo applications are completely portable across all Inferno platforms.[[#Citation|[1]]]

Limbo's approach to concurrency was inspired by Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes ([[CSP]]).[[#Citation|[2]]]
