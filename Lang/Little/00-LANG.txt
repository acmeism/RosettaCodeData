Little is a compiled-to-byte-code language that draws heavily from [[C]] and [[Perl]]. From C, Little gets C syntax, simple types (int, float, string), and complex types (arrays, structs). From Perl, Little gets associative arrays and regular expressions (PCRE). And from neither, Little gets its own simplistic form of classes.

The name "Little", abbreviated as simply "L", alludes to the language's simplicity. The idea was to distill the useful parts of other languages and combine them into a scripting language, with type checking, classes (not full-blown OO but useful none the less), and direct access to a cross-platform graphical toolkit.

Little provides a set of built-in functions, drawn from Perl and the standard C library.

Little is built on top of the Tcl/TK system. The Little compiler generates [[Tcl]] byte codes and uses the Tcl calling convention. This means that L and Tcl code may be intermixed. More importantly, it means that Little may use all of the Tcl API and libraries as well as TK widgets. The net result is a type-checked scripting language which may be used for cross-platform GUIs.

Little is open source under the same license as Tcl/TK (BSD like) with any bits that are unencumbered by the Tcl license also being available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
