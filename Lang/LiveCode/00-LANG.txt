LiveCode (formerly known as Revolution, and MetaCard before that) is a byte-code dynamically compiled language.
It started life as a Unix clone of HyperCard/HyperTalk, but goes far beyond that heritage by:
*Creating applications that run on:
** macOS (and previously classic Mac OS)
** Windows
** Linux (and previously various Unix)
** iOS
** Android
** Web Servers (with server engine version)
** Web Browser (HTML5 Emscripten engine as of version 8)
** Having a full interface toolkit with native widgets on all platforms
* Incorporating modern language features like regex, associative arrays, support for internet protocols, etc.
* Supporting color natively (HyperCard die-hards are now breathing a sigh of relief)
* As of version 8 the engine includes an additional, strictly typed language variant called [[Builder]] (LCB) which allows authoring custom graphical control widgets as well as access to foreign code libraries (version 9 supports C, Objective C, and JAVA libraries, others may be added in the future). There is also a method for using JavaScript within a browser widget and methods for exchanging data between the two languages. Additionally the engine can use other languages through a shell and open process functions, as well as OSA Scripting languages such as [[AppleScript]] on macOS.


* NOTE: Since September 1st 2021, LiveCode Ltd. has dropped support for their Community version, there is an effort to continue to support this free Open Source GPL3 version currently known as OpenXTalk, find out more at https://www.openxtalk.org.
