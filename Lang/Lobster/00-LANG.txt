'''Lobster''' is a general purpose programming language originally created for programming games. It has a [[Python]]-like syntax, with a static type system that feels like dynamic typing thanks to flow-sensitive type inference and specialization. It has lightweight anonymous functions, encouraging every function to look like a built-in control structure. Additionally it has vector operations, multi-methods, coroutines and immutable types.

It is currently implemented as a bytecode VM that runs on all desktop and mobile platforms (through SDL), and comes with built-in functionality for easy access to OpenGL, FreeType etc.
