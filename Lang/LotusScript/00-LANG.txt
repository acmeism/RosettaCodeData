{{language|LotusScript}}LotusScript is a programming language used in Lotus Notes and other [[IBM]]/Lotus products. It is very similar to [[Visual Basic]] (code can usually be copied between languages with little modification), but has many specific built-in classes for accessing objects within the Lotus Notes/Domino environment.

The Lotus Domino Designer application is the primary [[:Category:Integrated Development Environments|IDE]] used for developing programs in LotusScript, and also allows development in [[Java]]/[[JavaScript]] and Formula language.
