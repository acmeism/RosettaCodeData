Lychen is a C#/Clearscript wrapping of a JavaScript interpreter, in this case, V8. (The earlier project wrapped Microsoft JScript.) There are lots of command line JavaScript engines out there, all far more mature and powerful than this one. Node, for example.

Lychen is not supposed to be cutting-edge. Rather, it's on the spine of the blade, about as far from the cutting-edge as one can get without leaving the blade altogether.
