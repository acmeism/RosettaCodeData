The matrix-based MATLAB language is the worldâ€™s most natural way to express computational mathematics. Built-in graphics make it easy to visualize and gain insights from data. The MATLAB code can be integrated with other languages, enabling you to deploy algorithms and applications within web, enterprise, and production systems. For example, MATLAB is used for solutions in deep learning, computer vision, signal processing and control systems. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html]
