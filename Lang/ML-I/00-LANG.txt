ML/I is a general, stand alone, programmable macro processor. It is general in the sense that it can be used to process any kind of text. The text may be in any programming language or natural language, or it may be numerical data. It is stand alone in that it depends on no other program for its operation. It is programmable in that it can be programmed to carry out fairly complex operations when faced with varying kinds of input. In short, it is a very powerful tool.

Historically, the most important use of ML/I has been to provide users with a simple means of adding extra statements (or other syntactic forms) to an existing programming language in order to make the language more suitable for their own field of application. This process of extension may be carried to the level where the extended language could be regarded as a new language in its own right. Other possible uses of ML/I are program parameterisation (e.g. a parameter might determine whether debugging statements are to be included in a program) and various applications in text editing or correction and in data format conversion. It has been used, for instance, to format and convert files marked up with HTML. It has also been used as part of a microprogam translator for a bit slice computer implementation.

However, these are just a few applications. ML/I is very flexible, and there are many, many other uses for it. 

ML/I is an exceedingly long-lived language. It was first implemented in 1966, and is still in use.
