'''mLite''' is a is a general-purpose, functional, lightweight, dynamic programming language. It borrows ideas from both the Scheme [R4RS] and Standard ML [DEFSML] languages, taking most of its syntax from ML and its dynamic nature from Scheme. It extends ML-style pattern matching by adding guarded patterns and also introduces the principle of implicit guards. The implementation presented here is intended to be portable and easily realized on top of existing Scheme systems.
