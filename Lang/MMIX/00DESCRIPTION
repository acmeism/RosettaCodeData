Knuth's home page about MMIX says:

:''MMIX is a machine that operates primarily on 64-bit words. It has 256 general-purpose 64-bit registers that each can hold either fixed-point or floating-point numbers. Most instructions have the 4-byte form ‘OP X Y Z’, where each of OP, X, Y, and Z is a single 8-bit byte. For example, if OP is the code for ADD the meaning is “X=Y+Z”; i.e., “Set register X to the contents of register Y plus the contents of register Z.” The 256 possible OP codes fall into a dozen or so easily remembered categories.''

==Playing with MMIX==

In order to work with MMIX you'll have to download and install [http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/mmix-20090321.tar.gz MMIXware] . This provides you with a simple simulator, assembler, test programs, and full documentation, plus the meta-simulator.
