'''MariaDB''' is a relational database management system (RDBMS) with non-relational extensions, like JSON and dynamic columns. It was originally forked from MySQL. After Oracle acquired MySQL in 2009, its creator Michael "Monty" Widenius and other developers from the team created MariaDB. MariaDB was named after Monty's second daughter, Maria.

MariaDB is backed by two organisations: the MariaDB Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation that makes sure that MariaDB will remain free forever; and MariaDB plc, a company that provides MariaDB support and sells the MariaDB Enterprise edition. MariaDB code is distributed under the GNU GPL 2. Part of the code belongs to Oracle, because it derives from MySQL. MariaDB KnowledgeBase, its documentation, is available under that GNU FDL and the CC-BY-SA 3.0.

MariaDB SQL has procedural extensions, which can be used to develop stored procedures, stored functions, triggers and events, as well as anonymous code blocks. It also supports a PL/SQL parser, available when MariaDB is used in Oracle compatibility mode. User-Defined Functions can also be written in a compiled language and be used in SQL statements. MariaDB also supports storage engines and other types of plugins.
