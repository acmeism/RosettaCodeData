Mercury is a purely declarative functional logic programming language geared towards real-world applications. It is related to both [[Prolog]] and [[Haskell]]. It features a strong, static, polymorphic type system, as well as a strong mode 
and determinism system.

Mercury has several back-ends, Low-level [[C]], High-level [[C]], [[Java]], [[Erlang]], and [[C sharp|C#]].
