{{language|Metafont}}{{stub}}
Metafont is a programming language used to define vector fonts. It is also the name of the interpreter that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. PostScript. Metafont was devised by Donald Knuth as counterpart to his [[TeX]] typesetting system. (Text excerpt from [[wp:Metafont|Wikipedia]]).

The language can be used also outside its main purpose and field (like Postscript or TeX).
