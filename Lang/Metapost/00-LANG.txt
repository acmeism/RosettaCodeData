{{language|Metapont}}{{stub}}
Metapost is a programming language derived from D.E.Knuth's [[Metafont]] language, but its output is [[PostScript]] (hence the name) and therefore has extensions to the parent language, e.g. supports RGB colors; however, it has inherited some limitation of Metafont; the [[Asymptote]] language is another language in the "family", but without those limitations.
