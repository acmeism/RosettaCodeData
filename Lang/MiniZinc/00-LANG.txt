MiniZinc is a constraint modeling language developed by G12.  It was originally a subset of Zinc, but has since gained additional capabilities.  It compiles to a minimal subset called FlatZinc, which is interpreted by [https://www.minizinc.org/software.html#flatzinc constraint solvers].

MiniZinc can be used to state satisfaction and optimization problems in a high-level, declarative fashion.  It provides a [https://www.minizinc.org/doc-latest/en/lib.html standard library of common constraints], which can help modelers to formulate their models both readably and efficiently.

MiniZinc is at the heart of the [https://www.minizinc.org/challenge.html MiniZinc Challenge], a yearly competition that ranks constraint solvers on their ability to handle a wide array of satisfaction and optimization problems.
