'''Minimal BASIC''' is a standard for a very small subset of the [[BASIC]] programming language. It was established through the strict co-operation between ECMA and ANSI. It is specified in [https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-55_1st_edition_january_1978.pdf ECMA Standard 55], ANSI X3.60-1978, and ISO/IEC 6373:1984. It has a rigorous test suite (initially NBSIR 77-1420 from 1978) to ensure that vendors supplying computer systems to the US Federal government met compatibility guidelines.

The language is very limited:
* Line numbers are required.
* No string manipulation commands.
* All variables must be defined or modified using the <code>LET</code> keyword.
* The only loop structure is <code>FOR … TO … STEP …</code>, with loop parameters fixed at entry.
* All programs must end with an <code>END</code> statement.

Standard ECMA-55 references to the standards ECMA-6 (''7-Bit Input/Output Coded Charcater Set'') and ECMA-53 (''Representation of Source Programs'').

Implementations:
* Microsoft BASIC 5.0 for 8080 (BASIC-80, MBASIC for CP/M - 1981) claims compliance in its manual.

ECMA and ANSI also prepared a standard for [[Full BASIC]] (Standard ECMA-116).
