'''Miranda''' is a lazy, purely functional programming language designed in the 1980s by David Turner. It was the first functional programming language to have commercial support, and to be designed with real-world use in mind, rather than purely for academic purposes. Unfortunately, its proprietary nature ended up hampering its adoption. It had a large influence on Haskell, which was created in part to be a non-commercial alternative to Miranda.

There is still some ongoing development. The compiler was open-sourced under the BSD license in 2020. The newest version has 64-bit support and has been updated to compile on modern compilers.
