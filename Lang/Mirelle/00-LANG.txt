{{language programming paradigm|object-oriented}}
{{language programming paradigm|imperative}}Mirelle is a programming / scripting language for the [[.NET]] platform. It is designed to be strongly statically typed, imperative, object-oriented and keyboard-friendly.

It features a lightweight and clear syntax, inspired by [[Python]] and [[Ruby]], built-in abilities for graph plotting, matrix handling, and discrete-event simulation modelling.

Mirelle is implemented as a compiler which emits .exe files in the format of .NET assemblies. While not being very powerful yet, it can be extended by other .NET-compliant code.
