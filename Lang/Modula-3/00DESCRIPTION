'''Modula-3''' is a programming language created jointly at DEC and Olivetti by Luca Cardelli and others as an extension to Modula-2+, an extension of Niklaus Wirth's Modula-2 programming language.

Modula-3 is imperative, structured, modular, object oriented, generic, garbage collected, and type safe.

It contains a very nice threading syntax and implementation.

Its main implementation is [[Critical Mass Modula-3]].

Modula-3 influenced a few languages such as [[C Sharp|C#]], [[Java]], [[Ocaml]] and [[Python]].
