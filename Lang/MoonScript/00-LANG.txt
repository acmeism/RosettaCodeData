MoonScript is a dynamic scripting language that compiles into Lua. It gives you the power of one of the fastest scripting languages combined with a rich set of features.

MoonScript can either be compiled into [[Lua]] and run at a later time, or it can be dynamically compiled and run using the moonloader. Itâ€™s as simple as require "moonscript" in order to have Lua understand how to load and run any MoonScript file.

Because it compiles right into Lua code, it is completely compatible with alternative Lua implementations like LuaJIT, and it is also compatible with all existing Lua code and libraries.

The command line tools also let you run MoonScript directly from the command line, like any first-class scripting language.

A comprehensive overview of the language can be found in the [http://moonscript.org/reference/ reference manual], the rest of this page serves as an overview of the language.
