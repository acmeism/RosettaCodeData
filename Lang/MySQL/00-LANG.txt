'''MySQL''' is a multithreaded, multi-user, SQL Database Management System (DBMS) with more than six million installations.

'''MySQL''' is owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, Oracle, which holds the copyright to most of the codebase. This is similar to the JBoss model and how the Free Software Foundation handles copyright in its projects, and dissimilar to how the Apache project does it, where the software is developed by a public community, and the copyright to the codebase is owned by its individual authors.

The company develops and maintains the system, selling support and service contracts, as well as a cloud variant called HeatWave (part of Oracle Cloud), proprietary-licensed copies of MySQL, and employing people all over the world who collaborate via the Internet. MySQL AB was founded by David Axmark, Allan Larsson, and Michael "Monty" Widenius.
