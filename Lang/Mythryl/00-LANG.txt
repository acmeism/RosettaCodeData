Mythryl is a general-purpose, modular, functional programming language with compile-time type checking and type inference supporting both scripting and application development. Mythryl is self-hosting, that is to say the Mythryl compiler is written in Mythryl.

Mythryl is derived from [[derived from::SML/NJ]], a compiler and programming environment for [[Standard ML]]. It differs in that SML/NJ is a platform-neutral research testbed with an idiosyncratic syntax derived from Robin Milner's work with the logic framework LF, whereas Mythryl is a Linux-centric production-oriented software development platform with a C-flavored syntax.[[#Citation|[1]]]
