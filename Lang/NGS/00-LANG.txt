NGS tries to fill the void between classical shells such as bash and general-purpose programming languages such as Ruby, Python, Perl, Go. The shells are domain-specific languages but the domain has changed so classical shells are not optimal for today's tasks. General-purpose languages on the other hand are not domain-specific so they are not good as shells and too verbose for system tasks scripting, making them also not a good fit.

The language is now under development. Somewhat functional scripts can already be written, see https://github.com/ilyash/ngs/tree/master/c/demo
