{{stub}}{{language|NLP++}}

NLP++ is an open source computer programming language for natural language processing created by Amnon Meyers and David de Hilster in 1998. It operates on input text via multiple passes that elaborate a best-first parse tree. It can access and update a hierarchical knowledge base management system (KBMS) called Conceptual Grammar (CG). NLP++ and CG deploy with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called VisualText which supports rapid development of text analyzers. NLP++ is the only computer language exclusively dedicated to natural language processing.
