[http://cygnus-x.net/design/nq/ Nanoquery] is a Python-like query language being developed by Will Hinson. It was originally created to extract data from and perform operations with CSV files, but has expanded to work with data in other formats, including Excel workbooks.

As of January 2020, it is still under development, with new features being added semi-regularly.
