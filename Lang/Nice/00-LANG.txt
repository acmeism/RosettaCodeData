Nice is a new programming language. It extends the ideas behind object-orientation in order to better support modular programming and static type safety. It also incorporates features from functional programming, and puts into practice state-of-the-art results from academic research. This results in more expressivity, modularity and safety.[[#Citation|[1]]]

Source programs are compiled to [[Java]] bytecode, and can therefore interact with libraries written in Java and other programming languages targeting the Java Virtual Machine.[[#Citation|[2]]]

Nice supports [[wp:Multiple_dispatch|Multiple dispatch]].
