{{language|Night}}

'''Night''' is an interpreted language that focuses on simplicity and usability. The main goal of Night is to design an intuitive and safe language. It's dynamically typed and semi-weak.

What makes Night differ from other dynamically typed languages is its compile time checking. Whereas a language like Python wouldn't type check a variable, nor check if a variable even exists or not at compile time, Night fills this gap, eliminating hidden runtime bugs and providing a more reliable usage.

Also note that Night is still fairly new in the development process.
