{{language|Nom}}

Nom is an interpreted and also compiling (via the translation scripts)
language. Documentation for ''Nom'' can be found at [www.nomlang.org] along
with the downloadable [http://nomlang.org/download implementation]. 
All the source code is also hosted in [https://sourceforge.net sourceforge] 
at https://bumble.sf.net/books/pars/

Nom is based on the PEP (''Parsing Engine for Patterns'') virtual machine, 
which is a text-based virtual machine. The PEP virtual machine is 
documented at [http://nomlang.org/doc/machine/]. Nom was first ''conceived'' 
around about 2005 but a good working implementation (the 
[https://bumble.sf.net/books/pars/object/pep.c pep] interpreter) was not 
achieved until approximately 2019. 

Nom is, I believe a new approach to recognising/parsing/transforming/transpiling/compiling context-free languages
since it uses the same standard Unix-style approach of a ''text-stream-filter''
as with tools like ''sed'' or ''awk''.
