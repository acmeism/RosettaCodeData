'''OCaml''' (formerly known as Objective Caml) is the main implementation of the [[Caml]] [[programming language]], created by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy and others in 1996. OCaml is an [[open source]] project managed and principally maintained by INRIA.

OCaml extends the core [[derived from::Caml]] language with [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] constructs.

OCaml's toolset includes an interactive toplevel [[interpreter]], a [[bytecode]] [[compiler]], and an optimizing native code compiler. It has a large standard library that makes it useful for many of the same applications as [[Python]] or [[Perl]], as well as robust modular and object-oriented programming constructs that make it applicable for large-scale software engineering.

OCaml is the successor to [[Caml Light]]. The acronym CAML originally stood for Categorical Abstract Machine Language, although OCaml abandons this abstract machine.
