'''OPL (Open Programming Language'''; formerly '''Organiser Programming Language)''' is a high-level programming language designed primarily for use on mobile devices, particularly those running the Psion Series 3 and Series 5 operating systems. Developed in the early 1990s, '''OPL''' was created to provide a simple yet powerful environment for application development on handheld devices, allowing users to create software that could leverage the unique features of these portable platforms.

OPL is known for its ease of use, making it accessible to both novice and experienced programmers. The language features a syntax that is similar to [[BASIC]], which helps in rapid application development. It supports structured programming concepts, including variables, control structures, and functions, enabling developers to write clear and maintainable code.

One of the key strengths of OPL is its ability to interact seamlessly with the underlying operating system, allowing developers to access device-specific features such as file management, user interface elements, and hardware capabilities. This makes OPL particularly suitable for creating productivity applications, games, and utilities tailored for mobile users.

Despite its niche status, OPL has garnered a dedicated community of enthusiasts and developers who continue to explore its capabilities and create innovative applications. As mobile computing continues to evolve, OPL remains a notable example of early efforts to bring programming to handheld devices, showcasing the potential of portable technology in software development.
