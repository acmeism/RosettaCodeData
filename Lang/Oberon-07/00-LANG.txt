'''Oberon-07''' is a revision of the Oberon language by Niklaus Wirth. Oberon-07 is based on Wirth's original Oberon language (not [[Oberon-2]]), Wirth lists the changes [https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Oberon/Oberon07.pdf here], which are largely aimed at  simplification - in [https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Oberon/Oberon07.Report.pdf his defining document], Wirth quotes Einstein: "Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler".<br/><br/>

Oberon-07 contains a WHILE loop that allows multiple conditions and statements - similar to the loop in [[wp:Guarded_Command_Language|Edsgar Dijkstra's Guarded Command Language]], though with different syntax and without non-determinism. See [[Loops/N_plus_one_half#Oberon-07]] for an example.

In addition to the samples below, many of the [[Oberon-2]] samples should work with Oberon-07, particularly if the Oberon-07 compiler you are using allows LONGINT as a synonym for INTEGER (LONGINT, SHORTINT, LONGREAL and SHORTREAL were dropped from Oberon-07).
