'''Objeck ''' is an [[object-oriented]] computing language with [[functional programming|functional]] features. The language was based upon the author's use of [[Java]] and [[Scheme]]. In the language, all data types are treated as objects and first-class functions that support closures.

The programming environment consists of an optimizing compiler, command-line debugger, and virtual machine with associated [[Garbage collection|garbage collector]] and [[JIT]] compiler. The compiler emits binary [[bytecode]] that is executed by the runtime system. The 64-bit runtime JIT compilers support ARM64 and AMD64 machine code targets for macOS, Linux and Windows.
