The '''Objeck Programming Language''' is an [[object-oriented]] computing language with [[functional programming|functional]] features. The language has ties with [[Java]] and [[Scheme]]. In this language all data types, except for higher-order functions, are treated as objects.

The programming environment consists of an optimizing compiler,  command-line debugger and virtual machine with associated [[Garbage collection|garbage collector]] and [[JIT]] compiler. The compiler emits binary [[bytecode]] that is executed by the runtime system. The runtime system has the ability to translate the bytecode into AMD64 or IA-32 executable machine code on the fly.

The language can be [http://sourceforge.net/projects/objeck-lang/files/ obtained] from the main project homepage.  Also, check out the IRC channel #objeck on freenode.net.
