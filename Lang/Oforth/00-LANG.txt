Oforth is for Object + Forth : while based on Forth philosophy (data stack, one pass compilation, ...), it implements a full object metamodel.

Features include :
* Dynamic language (which does not mean a slow language). 
* Oforth comes with an interpreter : you can try things interactively.
* Object metamodel : everything is an object.
* Automatic garbage collection.
* Support of functional programming style and closures using blocks.
* While mutability is allowed, immutability is the default behavior, and sometimes required.
* Support of parallelism using ligth-weight tasks and communication using channels.
* Very concise language : "the more code you write, the more bugs you have"
