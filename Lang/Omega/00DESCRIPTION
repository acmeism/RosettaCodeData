There are at least two programming languages called Omega!

[http://www.pervasive.jku.at/About_Us/Staff/Blaschek/Omega/_Report/Introduction.html Omega] is a prototype-based programming language created by Günther Blaschek in the spirit of Smalltalk. It does not have classes in the sense of Smalltalk and C++, but prototypes as in Javascript, Self, Slate and Io.

[http://code.google.com/p/omega/ Omega]is a cross between a purely functional programming language and a theorem prover, conceived and implemented by Tim Sheard and his students. The syntax is borrowed from Haskell and has been moderately extended.
