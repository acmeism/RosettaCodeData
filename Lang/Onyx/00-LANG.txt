Onyx is a powerful stack-based, multi-threaded, interpreted, general purpose programming language similar to PostScript. It can be embedded as an extension language similarly to [[ficl]] ([[Forth]]), [[guile]] ([[scheme]]), [[librep]] ([[lisp]] dialect), [[s-lang]], [[Lua]], and [[Tcl]].

Onyx is perhaps the most advanced stack-based general purpose programming language in existence
It has the following distinguishing features:
* Double-ended stacks are first class objects
* Perl-compatible regular expressions.
* Loadable module system.
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) support similar to that of [[Objective-C]]
