From the website: ''Owl Lisp is a simple programming language. The main motivation for writing it was to get a portable system for writing standalone programs in a subjectively pleasant dialect of LISP, which in this case means a minimal core language and runtime, purely functional operation and support for asynchronous evaluation.''

Owl Lisp is similar to R7RS Scheme, but purely functional, without mutability.

The bytecode can be compiled to C.
