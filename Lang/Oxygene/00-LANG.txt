Oxygene is a Next Generation Object Pascal language development environment for creating managed applications for the Common Language Runtime – including Microsoft .NET and Novell's open source Mono framework – and the Java Runtime Environment – including regular Java and Android.

With Oxygene being written in itself, the compiler runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, giving developers a lot of flexibility in their working environment. It also generates 100% CLI-compliant assemblies for a wide variety of versions of the Common Language Runtime, including, of course, .NET 2.0 through 4.0 and Mono, but also the .NET Compact Framework, Silverlight and MonoTouch, as well as 100% pure JVM .jar files when building for Java or Android.
