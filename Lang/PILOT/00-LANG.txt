{{stub}}{{language|PILOT}}
'Programmed Instruction, Learning Or Teaching' is an imperative educational language developed in the 1960s by John A. Starkweather at the University of California, San Francisco. It is designed to make it very easy to write interactive classroom tests or quizzes:
<lang pilot>COMPUTE:year = 1804
TYPE:Who became French Emperor in #year?
ACCEPT:
MATCH:Napoleon,Bonaparte
YES:Correct!
NO:Sorry, it was Napoleon Bonaparte.</lang>

PILOT was also marketed in the 1980s as a first programming language for children and beginners, including in extended versions supporting turtle graphics; and it even found use as a scripting language under CP/M.

Keywords—written in block capitals in the example above—are case-insensitive and can usually be abbreviated to one or two letters (<code>T</code> for <code>TYPE</code>, <code>JM</code> for <code>JUMPMATCH</code>). The only data types supported are strings and integers.
