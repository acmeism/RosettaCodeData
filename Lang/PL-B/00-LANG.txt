PL/B is a dialect of the DATABUS language  created by the Datapoint Corporation in the early 1970's.  PL/B stands for Programming Language for Business and is designed to be easy to write, robust and scaleable.  DATABUS was approved as "ANSI Standard X3.238-1994." and reconfirmed in 1998.

The language still has a small but active following providing unashamedly commercial products to the business world.

PL/B is a commercial language/development product provided by Sunbelt Computer Systems Inc whose company and product details can be be found at https://www.sunbelt-plb.com/index.php
