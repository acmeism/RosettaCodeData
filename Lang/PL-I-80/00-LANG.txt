{{stub}} {{language|PL/I-80}} PL/I-80 implements an ANSI-defined general purpose subset ("Subset G") of the full [[PL/I]] programming language suitable both in scope and demands on machine resources for the 8-bit microcomputers of the late 1970s. (A 16-bit implementation, PL/I-86, was also available.) The compiler was written by Digital Research, the company founded by Gary Kildall to market the CP/M family of operating systems. According to the PL/I-80 programmers guide, Subset G "has the formal structure of the full language, but in some ways it is a new language, and in many ways an improved language compared to its parent." Like its parent, it was promoted as being suitable for both scientific and business applications.
