PL/I is a general purpose programming language suitable for commercial, scientific, non-scientific, and system programming.


It provides the following data types:

::* &nbsp; Floating-point,
::* &nbsp; Decimal integer,
::* &nbsp; Binary integer,
::* &nbsp; Fixed-point decimal &nbsp; (with a fractional part),
::* &nbsp; Fixed-point binary &nbsp; (that is, with a fractional part),
::* &nbsp; Pointers,
::* &nbsp; Character strings of two kinds:
::::# &nbsp; fixed-length, &nbsp; and
::::# &nbsp; varying-length.
::* &nbsp; Bit strings of two kinds:
::::# &nbsp; fixed-length, &nbsp; and
::::# &nbsp; varying length.

<br>
The &nbsp; float, &nbsp; integer, &nbsp; and &nbsp; fixed-point &nbsp; types can be &nbsp; real &nbsp; or &nbsp; complex.


Multiple precisions are available for binary fixed-point:
::* &nbsp; 8 bits, 
::* &nbsp; 16 bits, 
::* &nbsp; 32 bits, &nbsp; and 
::* &nbsp; 64 bits.


Multiple precisions are available for floating point:
::* &nbsp; 32 bits, 
::* &nbsp; 64 bits, &nbsp; and 
::* &nbsp; 80 bits.


The language provides for static and dynamic arrays. &nbsp; Of the latter, there are &nbsp; automatic, &nbsp; controlled, &nbsp; and &nbsp; based.
   
Controlled can be applied to any data type, including scalar, structure, as well as arrays. &nbsp; With controlled, a push-down and pop-up stack is automatically used.


PL/I has four kinds of I/O:
::# &nbsp; For simple I/O commands, list-directed input and output requires only the names of the variables. &nbsp; Default format is used, based on the variable's declaration.
::# &nbsp; For simple I/O commands, data-directed input and output requires only the names of the variables. &nbsp; For this form, both the names of the variables and their values are transmitted.
::# &nbsp; When precise layouts of input and output data is required, edit-directed I/O is used. &nbsp; A format is specified by the user. &nbsp; The format is flexible, and permits the number of digits, and the number of places after the decimal point to be specified dynamically. &nbsp; The format may also be specified in picture form.
::# &nbsp; For files held on storage media, record-oriented transmission is often used, either for &nbsp; sequential &nbsp; or &nbsp; random access.


PL/I has built-in checking for such programmer conditions including
::* &nbsp; subscript-range checking, 
::* &nbsp; floating-point overflow,
::* &nbsp; fixed-point overflow, 
::* &nbsp; division by zero, 
::* &nbsp; sub-string range checking, &nbsp; and
::* &nbsp; string-size checking.  

<br>
Any of those may be enabled or disabled by the user.

When any of those conditions occurs, the user/programmer may trap them and recover from them and continue execution.

PL/I has a unique and powerful pre-processor which is a subset of the full PL/I language so it can be used to perform &nbsp; (among other things): 
::* &nbsp; source file inclusion, 
::* &nbsp; conditional compilation, &nbsp; and 
::* &nbsp; macro expansion. 

<br>
The pre-processor keywords are prefixed with a &nbsp; <big>%</big> &nbsp; (percent symbol).
