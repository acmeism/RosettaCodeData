{{language|PL/SQL}}{{implementation|SQL}}'''PL/SQL''' (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's proprietary server-based procedural extension to the [[SQL]] database language. (Some other SQL database management systems offer languages similar to PL/SQL.) Its syntax strongly resembles that of [[Ada]].

IBM [[SQL PL|Db2 LUW]] (for Linux, UNIX and Windows) from version 9.7 supports natively Oracle's PL/SQL. That means, you can create stored procedures in Db2 with PL/SQL language.
