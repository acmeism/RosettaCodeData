{{stub}}{{language|PROMAL}}

The PROMAL programming language was created in 1984 by Systems Management Associates and was used on a number of micro computers of that era. The syntax is somewhat like a cross between [[Occam]] and [[Pascal]] with the mandatory indentation of Occam but without the concurrency.
