'''Palo Alto Tiny BASIC''' is one of the most popular of the many versions of [[Tiny BASIC]]. It was developed in 1975 by [[Li-Chen Wang]].

==Features==
Palo Alto Tiny BASIC has some features that distinguish it from other Tiny BASICs:
* The <code>FOR</code>...<code>NEXT</code> loop. Like in Microsoft BASIC, the upper and lower bounds of the loop are set on loop entry, and did not change during the loop, so if one of the bounds is based on a variable expression, changing the variable do not change the bound. The <code>STEP</code> modifier is optional.
* The ability to place several statements on a single line. Palo Alto Tiny BASIC uses the semicolon <code>;</code> to separate statements, rather than the colon <code>:</code> common in BASICs.
* A single numeric one-dimensional array, with the variable name <code>@</code>.
* The statement <code>STOP</code> in addition to <code>END</code>.
* The use of <code>#</code> for not-equals in comparisons, as opposed to <code><></code>.
* The ability to set more than one variable in a single <code>LET</code> command: <syntaxhighlight lang="basic">LET A=1,B=0,A=A+2</syntaxhighlight>The word <code>LET</code> in a <code>LET</code> command can be omitted.
* Lack of <code>THEN</code> in an <code>IF</code> command.
* Numeric results of compare operations: 1 (if true), 0 (if false). Thus, one can use them in arithmetic expression. Note: <syntaxhighlight lang="basic">LET A=B=0</syntaxhighlight> means "set <code>A</code> to the result of comparing <code>B</code> with 0".
* A prompt in an <code>INPUT</code> command. If the prompt is omitted, the default is a name of the variable. E.g. <syntaxhighlight lang="basic">INPUT "WHAT IS THE HEIGHT"H</syntaxhighlight> will print <code>WHAT IS THE HEIGHT:</code> and wait to read an expression from the input device.<syntaxhighlight lang="basic">INPUT H</syntaxhighlight> will print <code>H:</code> and so on.

==Implementations==
Palo Alto Tiny BASIC was adapted for many implementations:
* [[3K Control Basic]] for [[Cromemco]] (by Li-Chen Wang)
* [[Level I BASIC]] (1977)
* [[Sharp PC-1211 BASIC]] (1980)
* [[Astro BASIC]] (1982, by Jamie Fenton)
