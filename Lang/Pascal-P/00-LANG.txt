'''Pascal-P''' is a renowned [[:Category:Pascal|Pascal]] compiler designed to generate [[bytecode]], known as ''p-code'', and interpret the resulting code. The compilers and interpreters of Pascal-P are developed using the Pascal programming language. 

Originally developed in Zurich in 1973, the earliest iteration of Pascal-P, known as Pascal-P1, laid the foundation for subsequent versions, including P2, P3, and P4. While versions P1 and P3 are no longer accessible, P2 is still readily available and has notably served as the base for the UCSD system. Furthermore, there exist derivative versions, such as P5 and P6, which have evolved from the core Pascal-P compiler.

Notably, Pascal-P is heralded for its portability, as it is capable of generating code suitable for a hypothetical stack computer system. This feature enhances its versatility and applicability across various platforms and environments. Additionally, Pascal-P has made significant contributions to the realm of education, often being utilized as an educational tool to impart knowledge and foster learning in the field of computer programming.
