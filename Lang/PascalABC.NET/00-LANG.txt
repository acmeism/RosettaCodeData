{{language|PascalABC.NET}}

PascalABC.NET is the new generation Pascal programming language that combines simplicity of classic Pascal, a great number of modern extensions and broad capabilities of Microsoft .NET Framework.

PascalABC.NET will compile much of the Pascal and Delphi on this site, but let me hope that entries an RosettaCode will use the modern functional extensions and not look like something from 1970.

True I could write fN in the following example in Delph, but I would risk a repetitive wrist injury. For those wishing to save their wrist for things more important than writing verbose code:

<syntaxhighlight lang="pascal">
begin
  var fN: integer->integer->integer := x -> y -> x + y;
  var n := fN(2);
  writeln(n(11));
  writeln(n(21));
end.
</syntaxhighlight>
