{{codepad}}'''Perl''' is both the name of a programming language and the name of the primary implementation of that language.

As a language, it takes the best from other programming languages such as [[derived from::BASIC]], [[derived from::Lisp]], [[derived from::C]] and the [[Unix]] tools [[derived from::sed]], [[derived from::AWK]] and [[derived from::UNIX Shell| the UNIX shell]]. It is particularly suited for Unix systems programming, [[:Category:Text processing|text processing]] and [[Data Munging|gluing heterogeneous programs together]]. Its interpreter is called perl. Perl has seen five major revisions, and [[Perl 6|a sixth]] is currently being worked on.

The implementation known as Perl is available on a wide variety of mostly UNIX-based operating systems.
