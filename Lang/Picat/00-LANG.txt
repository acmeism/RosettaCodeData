Picat is a simple, and yet powerful, logic-based multi-paradigm programming language aimed for general-purpose applications, including non-determinism, tabling, constraint solving (Constraint Programming, SAT, and MIP), planning, functions, list comprehensions, and general imperative constructs such as for loops, while loops, and re-assignments. Picat is available via http://picat-lang.org/ .
