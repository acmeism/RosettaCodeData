'''Plain English''' is a programming language written [https://www.quora.com/In-procedural-programming-how-do-you-plan-your-code-without-UML/answer/Gerry-Rzeppa during the winter of 2005-2006] that:
* Has keywords like A, AN, and THE.
* Lets you code what you're thinking.
* Can compile itself in 3 seconds.
<br/>
Plain English can be run from within its Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (see "Complete IDE download" below)
or compiled to a self-contained Microsoft Windows .exe file.

The noodle built into Plain English is simply not useful enough by itself, and therefore libraries were created to assist in writing Rosetta Code tasks in Plain English.
