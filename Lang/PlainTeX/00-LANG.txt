{{language|plainTeX}}
Donald Knuth's techne (from the greek τέχνη, which he abbreviated to [[TeX|{{TeX}}]]) is a set of primitive tokens which are complex to use on their own. Knuth wrote composite operations of these primitive tokens himself, called macros, to make document creation easier.

The base techne and a set of macros together are called a format of techne. [[plainTeX|{{PlainTeX}}]] is the simplest format.

Often when referencing [[TeX|{{TeX}}]], it is implied that [[plainTeX|{{PlainTeX}}]] is used.

Extensions to the [[plainTeX|{{PlainTeX}}]] format exist, such as eplain([[TeX|{{TeX}}]]) or [[LaTeX|{{LaTeX}}]].
