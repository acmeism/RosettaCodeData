Pluto is a superset of Lua 5.4 with a focus on general-purpose programming. While being remarkably compatible with Lua 5.4 source-code & bytecode, it enhances the standard library & adds more than a dozen highly-desired syntaxes such as switch statements, compound operators, classes, class inheritance, string interpolation, type hinting, enums, and so on.

Pluto aspires to be a version of Lua with a larger feature-set, that is all. Pluto is not a Lua-killer, an attempted successor, or any of that. Many people (rightly so) love Lua precisely because of the design philosophy. And fundamentally, Pluto is a major deviation from Lua's design philosophy. Some may prefer this, some may not.

The language is being developed on [https://github.com/PlutoLang/Pluto github] and pre-built binaries for 64-bit Linux, MacOS and Windows can be downloaded [https://github.com/PlutoLang/Pluto/releases here].
