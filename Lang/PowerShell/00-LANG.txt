{{language programming paradigm|reflective}}'''PowerShell''' is a shell and scripting language released by [[Microsoft]] in 2006. Like other shells, PowerShell has a piping mechanism where the output of one command is passed as input to another command. However, unlike most shells, PowerShell passes ''objects'' rather than strings. This eliminates the text munging overhead usually necessary to make the pieces of a script fit together.

PowerShell is built on Microsoft's [[.NET]] framework and has full access to the CLR.
