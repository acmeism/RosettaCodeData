Processing.R (aka Processing R mode) combines Renjin, an R language interpreter running on the JVM, with the graphics infrastructure and vocabulary of {{header|Processing}}. It is not a library, and it cannot run on either a standard R interpreter or under Processing (Java mode). It can be installed in the Processing Development Environment (PDE), and can also run on the command line as a stand-alone jar. 

Procesing.R supports:

* native R programming and syntax
* most Processing built-in functions (draw(), rect(), box(), etc.)
* importing select Processing(Java) libraries (e.g. "peasycam")
* importing select R Packages (e.g. "foreach") that run on Renjin


{{header|Processing}} is a flexible software sketchbook and a ecosystem of tools for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.
