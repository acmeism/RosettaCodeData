|exec=interpreted}}Qore is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. It's a thread-capable, embeddable, weakly typed language with optional strong typing and procedural and object-oriented features designed for anything from quick scripting to complex multithreaded, network-aware application development to embedded application scripting. Qore was initially designed to facilitate the rapid implementation of sophisticated interfaces in embedded code in an enterprise environment, and has since grown into a general-purpose language as well.
