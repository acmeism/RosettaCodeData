'''Rapira''' is a procedural programming language. It was an interpreted language with dynamic type system and high level constructions. Rapira was used in teaching computer programming in Soviet schools. The programming environment included a text editor and an integrated debugger.

Russian was the only language Rapira supported at its conception, but support for English (as well as Romanian and Moldovan) was added since then.
