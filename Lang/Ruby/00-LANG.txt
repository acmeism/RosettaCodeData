{{codepad}}Ruby is an interpreted language written by Yukihiro "matz" Matsumoto that originates from Japan.

It is a language that combines
* Joy of programming
* Powerful [[object-oriented]] style
* Flexibility and extensibility
* [[Platform]] independence

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator blended parts of his favorite languages ([[Perl]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Eiffel]], [[Ada]], and [[Lisp]]) to form a new language that balances [[functional programming]] with [[imperative programming]].

He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.

Since its public release in 1995, Ruby has drawn devoted coders worldwide. In 2006, Ruby achieved mass acceptance. The [http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm TIOBE] index, which measures the growth of programming languages, ranks Ruby as #11 among programming languages worldwide. Much of the growth is attributed to the popularity of software written in Ruby, particularly the Rails web framework.
