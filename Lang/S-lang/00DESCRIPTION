S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer's library designed to allow a developer to create robust multi-platform software. It provides facilities required by interactive applications such as display/screen management, keyboard input, keymaps, and so on. The most exciting feature of the library is the slang interpreter that may be easily embedded into a program to make it extensible. While the emphasis has always been on the embedded nature of the interpreter, it may also be used in a stand-alone fashion through the use of slsh, which is part of the S-Lang distribution. 

Unlike many interpreters, the S-Lang interpreter supports all of the native C integer types (signed and unsigned versions of char, short, int, long, and long long), and both single and double precision types, as well as a double precision complex type. Other data types supported by the interpreter include strings, lists, associative arrays (hashes), user-defined structures, and multi-dimensional arrays of any data-type. 

The S-Lang interpreter has very strong support for array-based operations making it ideal for numerical applications. (from [http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/ the official web site]])
