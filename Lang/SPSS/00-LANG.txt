[[:wp:SPSS|SPSS]] is a statistical software package created in 1968 and currently developed by IBM.

Long produced by SPSS Inc., it was acquired by IBM in 2009. The current versions (2015) are officially named IBM SPSS Statistics. Companion products in the same family are used for survey authoring and deployment (IBM SPSS Data Collection), data mining (IBM SPSS Modeler), text analytics, and collaboration and deployment (batch and automated scoring services).

The software name originally stood for Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) reflecting the original market, although the software is now popular in other fields as well, including the health sciences and marketing.
