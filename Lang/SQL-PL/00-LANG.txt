'''SQL PL''' is the procedural language written by IBM for its set of databases called Db2. There are different types of Db2, each for a different platform (The names had changed<ref>Db2: A Small but Significant Change [http://ibmsystemsmag.com/blogs/db2utor/july-2017/db2-a-small-but-significant-change/]</ref><ref>IBMâ€™s June Announcements About DB2 [http://db2commerce.com/2017/06/23/ibms-june-announcements-about-db2/]</ref><ref>Revised naming for IBM Db2 family products [https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=an&subtype=ca&appname=gpateam&supplier=897&letternum=ENUS217-363]</ref>):

* Db2 LUW - For Linux, UNIX and Windows.
* Db2 for i - For the mainframes previously called AS/400.
* Db2 for z - For z/OS mainframes.
