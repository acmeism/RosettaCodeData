'''Scratch''' is an educational programming language that allows people of any experience, background or age to experiment with the concepts of fully versatile computer programming by using an alterable GUI. It is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab by a team led by Mitchel Resnick and first appeared in the summer of 2007. Scratch can be installed and freely redistributed on any Windows, Mac OS X or Linux computer. The source code is made available under a license that allows modifications for non-commercial uses.
