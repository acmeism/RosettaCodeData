{{language programming paradigm|object-oriented}}'''Seed7''' is a general-purpose programming language designed by Thomas Mertes. It is a higher level language compared to [[Ada]], [[C]] / [[C++]] and [[Java]]. The Seed7 interpreter, and the example programs are [[Open source|open-source]] software. An open-source Seed7 [[compiler]] is also available.

In Seed7 new statements and operators can be declared easily. Functions with type results and type parameters are more elegant than the usual template or generics concept. [[Object-oriented_programming|Object orientation]] is used when it brings advantages and not in places when other solutions are more obvious. Although Seed7 contains several concepts of other programming languages it cannot be seen as direct descendant of another programming language.
