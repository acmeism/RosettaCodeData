{{language|SenseTalk}}

SenseTalk is the world's first People Oriented Programming language: It is Task-oriented (very high level), Intuitive (English-like, both readable and writable), and Human-centric (flexible, familiar, fluid, works the way people think).

The SenseTalk language is in the XTalk family (derived from HyperTalk) and was designed primarily by Douglas Simons. First released in 1992. Since 2002 SenseTalk has been the scripting language in Eggplant Functional for writing test automation scripts.
