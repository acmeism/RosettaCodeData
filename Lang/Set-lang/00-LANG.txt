[https://www.reddit.com/r/esolangs/comments/54b0b1/set_an_language_with_1_command/ Original reddit post] by the user [https://www.reddit.com/user/qwertyu63 qwertyu63], with the original specifications on how the language works.

The '''Set''' language uses only a single command, ''set''. It allows for 52 development variables and 1 system variable.
It is ASCII based, so output is in the integer format, and is converted to characters upon ran.

There is currently an [https://avellar.ml/set-lang online implementation] of a '''Set''' interpreter, done in JavaScript. A [https://github.com/MatheusAvellar/set-lang public GitHub repository] also exists, so feel free to contribute.
