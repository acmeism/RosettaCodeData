Sidef is a modern, dynamic, object-oriented programming language, focusing on simplicity, readability and elegance, taking the best from languages like [[derived from::Ruby]], [[derived from::Go]], [[derived from::Raku]] and [[derived from::Julia]].

The language is mostly used as a research programming language.
