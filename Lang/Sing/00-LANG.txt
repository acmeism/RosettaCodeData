The Sing language is an attempt to implement a language which is simple and safe and with a low adoption barrier by c++ programmers.

The language is specified in a way that make it simple to transpile to readable (seemingly human written) c++. This means that adopting sing you are not giving up c++, you are just using sing to write it. At the same time you enjoy the advantage of a more guided/simple/safe language.
