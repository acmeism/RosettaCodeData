'''Slope''', or ''SLOum's Programming Environment'', is a multi-[[:Category:Programming Paradigms|paradigm]] programming language. It was initially based on [[derived from::Scheme]] and supports [[procedural programming]] and [[functional programming]]. It was developed by sloum in 2021. Slope is not a strictly defined language and has a single interpreter implementation written in [[Go]].

Slope is meant to be easy to learn and come with enough batteries included to get most programming tasks done easily and quickly.

Slope is lexically scoped, has a package manager and central repository, and comes with a featureful repl to allow for repl driven programming.
