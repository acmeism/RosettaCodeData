'''SparForte''' is command shell, scripting and template language for reliable and secure projects for mission-critical business.  (Technically SparForte is the implementation and AdaScript is the language.)

It combines a Bourne shell backwards compatible with ISO standard Ada 95, as well as features of reliable languages such as D, Rust, as well as original concepts.  These include strong typing and duck typing, programming-by-contract, side effect detection, integrated unit testing, etc.

Supported platforms include Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS and minimal support for Cygwin on Windows.

SparForte is hobby of Ken O. Burtch, IT architect and author of "Linux Shell Scripting with Bash".  Contributions are also made by volunteers.  It is open source licensed.
