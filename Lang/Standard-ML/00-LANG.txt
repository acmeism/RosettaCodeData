'''Standard ML''' (SML) is a general-purpose, modular, [[functional programming]] language with [[compile-time]] [[type checking]] and type inference. It is popular among compiler writers and programming language researchers, as well as in the development of theorem provers.

SML is a modern descendant of the [[derived from::ML]] programming language used in the LCF theorem-proving project. It is unique among widely used languages in that it has a formal specification, given as typing rules and operational semantics in The Definition of Standard ML (1990, revised and simplified as The Definition of Standard ML (Revised) in 1997).
