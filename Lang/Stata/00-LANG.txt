[[:wp:Stata|Stata]] is a statistical software package created in 1985 and developed by StataCorp, located in College Station, Texas. Stata includes a command-based macro language (informally called "Ado") and a matrix language called Mata. A large part of Stata is itself written in Ado and Mata, with source code available.

Stata has also APIs to call C and Java plugins, and since Stata version 16, can embed Python code within Ado programs.
