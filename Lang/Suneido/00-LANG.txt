<blockquote><p>Suneido™ is a complete, integrated application platform - a system for developing and deploying applications without the frustrations of integrating multiple different products. Suneido incorporates an object-oriented programming language, client-server relational database software, and application frameworks and components. It includes the integrated development environment ([[IDE]]) used to create applications as well as the client and server required to run applications across networks. Suneido is [[open source]] - it is provided free, with complete source code. </p>

<p>Our mission is to provide a simple, open, lightweight, industrial strength alternative to large, complex, expensive, closed application technologies such as [[Visual Basic]], Access, FoxPro, [[Delphi]], [[Oracle]], and SQL Server.</p>

<p>Suneido currently runs on [[Microsoft]] [[Windows]] NT, 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, and Windows 7. </p></blockquote>
