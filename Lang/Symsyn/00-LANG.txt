Symsyn is a simple programming language and realtime multitasking operating environment.  A Symsyn program consists of one or more instructions.  Each instruction maps directly to a Pascal procedure which resides in the runtime emulator. There are three data types: 64 bit word, 8 bit character, and Ansi strings.

Features:

Re-assignable version specific opcodes. 
Extensible architecture designed to accommodate new instructions. 
Written in Pascal - any Pascal procedure can be reduced to an instruction. 
Bit, character, and word manipulation.
