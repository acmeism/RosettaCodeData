{{language|TI-57}}
The TI-57 was a programmable calculator made by Texas Instruments between 1977 and 1982. It had 50 program steps and 8 memory registers, and was able to handle single-precision floating-point numbers.

The programming language is similar to a primitive macro assembler. Any keystroke could be stored, along with basic program flow control commands and conditional tests. The TI-57 used the "one step, one instruction" principle, regardless of whether one instruction required one or up to four keypresses.

Tests for equality/inequality could be performed against a value on the display (the x register) and a dedicated register (the memory register #7, also named t). The result of the test would cause the next instruction to be conditionally skipped.

Targeted users were highschool students and engineers: basic mathematical, trigonometrical and statistical functions were therefore available.
