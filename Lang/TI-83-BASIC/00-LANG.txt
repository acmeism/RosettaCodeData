'''TI-83 BASIC''' is not affiliated with [[BASIC]] .

'''TI-83 BASIC''' or TI-BASIC 83 is the high-level language used on TI-83/84/83+/84+ Z80 calculators (aside from the assembly which is also on the calculator).

==Elements of language==
===Control flow===
The language contains control flow for structured programming. 
The main control flow statements are:
====If====
<lang ti83b>If condition
Then
...
Else
...
End</lang>
====For====
<lang ti83b>For(variable,start,stop,step)
...
End</lang>
====While====
<lang ti83b>While condition
...
End</lang>
====Repeat====
<lang ti83b>Repeat condition
...
End</lang>
===Data types===
'''TI-BASIC''' is a strongly and dynamically-typed language
Variables are global. There is no local variables. So programs cannot be recursive, even if a program can call itself.
* '''Numerical variables''', 27 variables from A to Z and theta. These allow real numbers or complex numbers (implemented as pairs of reals) to be stored in floating point format. Values may range from 1E-99 to 1E99 with up to ten digits of accuracy.
* '''Strings''', 10 strings from Str1 to Str9 and Str0.
* '''Lists''', including L1 - L6, with the ability to create additional ones. These are essentially one-dimensional arrays used to store a real or complex number into each of their elements. (L1(4) would return the value of L1 at n=4)
* '''Matrices''', 8 matrices from [A] to [J]. Their elements are subject to the same restrictions as lists. Their dimensions may be defined up to 99x99 elements, although, again, available memory will limit this. ([A](3,4) would design item at row=3 column=4)
* '''Equation variables''', 10 y(x) functions: from Y1 to Y9 and Y0, 6 r(theta) polar functions: r1 - r6, and 3 u(n) integer sequences: u, v, w. (Y1(4) would return the value of Y1 at X=4, X is a real)

==Example==
One popular example is the quadratic formula program. 
<lang ti83b>Prompt A,B,C
BÂ²-4AC->D
(-B-sqrt(D))/(2A)->Y
(-B+sqrt(D))/(2A)->X
{Y,X}</lang>
As far there is a complex mode and variable can be real or complex, this program is very ubiquitous.
