'''TI-83 BASIC''' or '''TI-BASIC''' is the high-level language used on TI-83/84/+/SE calculators (aside from the assembly which is also on the calculator). TI-83 BASIC is the older brother of [[TI-89 BASIC]]. One of the main complaints with TI-83 BASIC is that there is no native function that tells time, this feature was added in the TI-84+. The language itself, however, is a powerful language capable of many things; nested loops and string manipulation among others. Many students create small programs on their calculators to help them through tests and homework. One popular example is a quadratic formula program. TI-83 BASIC is not affiliated with [[BASIC]] and is not as similar to it as the name would suggest. Someone who has experience writing code in [[C]] or [[C++]] should have no trouble working with this language.
