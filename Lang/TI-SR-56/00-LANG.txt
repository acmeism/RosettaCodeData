The Texas Instruments [http://www.datamath.org/Sci/WEDGE/sr-56.htm SR-56] is a programmable calculator manufactured in 1976 and 1977.

These calculators have 100 steps (bytes) of program memory, ten general-purpose registers (0-9) and a test register (t) for conditional branching.

Unlike its Hewlett-Packard competitors, the SR-56 does not use Reverse-Polish Notation (RPN), but standard infix math with operator precedence.
