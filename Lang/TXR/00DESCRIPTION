TXR is a new language implemented in [[C]], running on POSIX platforms such as [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and on Windows via [[Cygwin]] as well as more natively thanks to [[MinGW]].

TXR started as a language for "reversing here-documents": evaluating a template of text containing variables, plus useful pattern matching directives, against some body of text and binding pieces of the text which matches variables. The variable bindings were output in POSIX shell variable assignment syntax, allowing for shell code like

<code>eval $(txr <txr-program> <args> ...)</code>

TXR remains close to these roots: its main language is the pattern-based text extraction notation well suited for matching large regions of
entire text documents.  

About the <code>@</code> character: this serves as a multi-level escape in TXR. In the fundamental TXR syntax, which is literal text, this character is a signal which indicates that the object which follows is a variable or directive. Then inside a directive, the character indicates that the object which follows is a TXR Lisp expression to be evaluated as such, rather than according to the expression evaluation rules of the pattern language.  (And it is possible for TXR Lisp code to give this character additional meanings, since inside TXR Lisp, the notation expands to Lisp syntax: <code>@foo</code> denotes <code>(sys:var foo)</code>, and <code>@(foo ...)</code> denotes <code>(sys:expr foo>)</code>. In any context which needs to separate meta-variables and meta-expressions from variables and expressions, this may come in handy.)

Thus, the source of a TXR query is literal text except for directives and variables preceded by the <code>@</code> character.

In this pattern language, computation evolves by textual pattern matching with implicit backtracking. Non-pattern matching activities are embedded into a pattern matching paradigm.  For instance, the line

<pre>Four score and seven years ago,</pre>

is a TXR directive which matches a line of that exact text, or else fails. The following is also a directive:

<lang txr>@(bind foo "abc")</lang>

which succeeds if <code>foo</code> has no prior binding, or already contains <code>"abc"</code>, but fails if <code>foo</code> has a binding to something other than <code>"abc"</code>.

The success of a directive means that computation proceeds to the next directive (and, if this is a pattern match, the input position advances). Failure means that the enclosing query fails, triggering back-tracking behaviors and possibly failure of the entire query.

A bizarre feature of TXR is that the directives like <code>@(collect)</code> are independent pieces of Lisp. But, they are also de-facto "tokens" in a block-structure language. For instance <code>@(collect)</code> starts a block, which must be terminated by <code>@(end)</code>. Inside <code>@(collect)</code> there can be additional syntax, such as <code>@(collect :gap 0 :vars (a b c))</code>.

==Extremely Simple Query==

Extract first matching line from the password file. Of course, TXR matches are not restricted to single line!

<lang bash>$ txr -c '@(skip)
@user:@pw:@uid:@gid:@gecos:@home:@shell' /etc/passwd</lang>
<pre>
user="root"
pw="x"
uid="0"
gid="0"
gecos="root"
home="/root"
shell="/bin/bash"</pre>

Now, pre-bind the <code>user</code> variable first to retrieve some other user. Now <code>@(skip)</code> kicks into action, skipping non-matching material:

<lang bash>$ txr -Duser=sshd -c '@(skip)
@user:@pw:@uid:@gid:@gecos:@home:@shell' /etc/passwd</lang>
<pre>user="sshd"
pw="x"
uid="114"
gid="65534"
gecos=""
home="/var/run/sshd"
shell="/usr/sbin/nologin"</pre>


==Simple Query==

Re-implement the "free" utility on Linux, showing an overview of memory use:

<lang txr>#!/usr/bin/txr -f
@(next "/proc/meminfo")
@(define num (n))@\
  @(local numtok)@{numtok /[0-9]+/}@(bind n @(int-str numtok 10))@\
@(end)
@(gather)
MemTotal: @(num TOTAL) kB
MemFree: @(num FREE) kB
Buffers: @(num BUFS) kB
Cached: @(num CACHED) kB
SwapTotal: @(num SWTOT) kB
SwapFree: @(num SWFRE) kB
@(end)
@(bind USED @(- TOTAL FREE 10))
@(bind RUSED @(- USED BUFS CACHED))
@(bind RFREE @(+ FREE BUFS CACHED))
@(bind SWUSE @(- SWTOT SWFRE))
@(output)
               TOTAL         USED         FREE      BUFFERS       CACHED
Mem:    @{TOTAL -12} @{USED  -12} @{FREE  -12} @{BUFS  -12} @{CACHED -12}
+/- buffers/cache:   @{RUSED -12} @{RFREE -12}
Swap:   @{SWTOT -12} @{SWUSE -12} @{SWFRE -12}
@(end)</lang>

Sample run:

<pre>$ ./meminfo.txr
               TOTAL         USED         FREE      BUFFERS       CACHED
Mem:          769280       647752       121528       160108       286844
+/- buffers/cache:         200800       568480
Swap:        1048568        18200      1030368
</pre>

== Complex Query ==

Here is a TXR query for computing the complete dependencies of a C source file (including system and compiler headers) on a typical GNU/Linux system, demonstrating features like parallel clauses, recursion and exception handling.
