TECO stands for Text Editor and COrrector. (Originally "Tape Editor and COrrector"). It originated as a macro language for text editing, screen handling and keyboard management. TECO has a reputation for being cryptic and hard to learn. (TECO programs are said to resemble line noise when using a modem over a telephone line.)
TECO was an early, string-processing language used by the first Emacs. It made maintenance hard, and also made extensions hard to write.
The first EMACS editor was written in TECO. The name Emacs originates from the phrase "editor macros", or macros in TECO for editing.
