'''Tiny BASIC''' is a subset of the [[BASIC]] programming language, originally developed in 1975 by Dennis Allison and others. It was designed for hobbyists who couldn't afford the cost of a full [[Microsoft]] BASIC package, or didn't have enough memory to run it. It was meant to be easily extensible, and people extended it from pretty early on.
