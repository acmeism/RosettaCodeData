{{compiler}}Toka is a concatenative programming language with similarities to [[:Category:Forth|Forth]]. It has two accessible [[Stack|stacks]] for passing data, a dictionary which maps names to functions, an [[interpreter]], a [[compiler]] (generating threaded code), a form of [[garbage collection]], and various functions to aid in debugging and inspecting compiled code. Toka also has a set of optional libraries that extend the core language in many ways.
