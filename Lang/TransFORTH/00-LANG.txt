{{stub}}{{language|TransFORTH}}
TransFORTH (or TransFORTH ][) is a compiled language and interactive programming environment for the Apple II computer, developed by Paul Lutus and released in 1981. It may be regarded either as a somewhat divergent dialect of Forth or as a separate language with clear Forth ancestry.
