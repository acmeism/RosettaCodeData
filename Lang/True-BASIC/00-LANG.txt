True BASIC is a variant of the BASIC programming language descended from Dartmouth BASIC, the original BASIC. It was invented by college professors John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz. 

It is an interpreted, procedural language and sold as a commercial product. Versions have existed for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and the Atari ST. The latest version of the language is 6.007 and currently only runs on Microsoft Windows.
