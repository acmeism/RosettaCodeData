Unicon is a unification of several extended dialects of the [[derived from::Icon]] language, featuring Icon plus classes, POSIX system facilities, GDBM and ODBC-based (SQL) database access, packages, 3D graphics and more, all provided at a very high semantic level.  

In addition to Icon, Unicon draws from:
* IDOL an object-oriented Icon preprocessor
* MTIcon a multi-threading Icon. (Most recently, in version 12, improved multi-threading capabilities were added.)

While Unicon is mostly a super-set of Icon there are some differences and incompatibilities.

Icon itself is an evolution of the line of languages [[wp:COMIT|COMIT]], SNOBOL, [[:Category:SNOBOL4|SNOBOL4]], and SL5.
