VBScript is a programming language from [[Microsoft]] for [[Windows]] and [[wp:Active Server Pages|Active Server Pages]] (and web page scripting on the Internet, to a much lesser degree). VBScript is similar to [[Visual Basic]], and was originally based on VB, but there are many differences between the two. In general, VBScript is not able to run most non-trivial VB programs without significant changes, while ''most'' VBScript programs can be run in VB with trivial changes.

VBScript can be run on Windows using two different interpreters: '''Wscript''', which provides a windowed interface, and '''Cscript''', which runs from the console.
