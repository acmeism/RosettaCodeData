Verbexx.exe is an interpreter for a simple scripting language called verbexx.  Verbexx.exe runs  from the Windows 10 command line, and reads text files containing verbexx source code.  The filetype can be anything, but .txt seems to work well.

Verbexx is in the early stages of development, and will likely never be finished.  It is not the least bit notable or important, and is likely to remain that way.
