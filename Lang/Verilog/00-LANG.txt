In the semiconductor and electronic design industry, Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. Verilog HDL, not to be confused with VHDL, is most commonly used in the design, verification, and implementation of digital logic chips at the register transfer level (RTL) of abstraction. It is also used in the verification of analog and mixed-signal circuits.
