From the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/ Visual Basic Developer Center] website: "With Visual Basic, you can create applications for Windows, the Web, mobile devices, and Office on the .NET Framework". Visual Basic .NET makes it easy to create [[Windows]] form applications quickly and efficiently. The language is [[object-oriented]] and has unique features to speed development and deployment.

Visual Basic .NET, like C# and other .NET languages, runs on the Microsoft [[runs on vm::Common Language Runtime|Common Language Runtime]] VM.

Not to be confused with [[:Category:Visual Basic|Visual Basic]], the original pre-.NET, implementation, which has only a passing resemblance to VB.NET.
