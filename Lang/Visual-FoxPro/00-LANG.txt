'''Visual FoxPro''' is a discontinued programming language developed by Microsoft(formerly Fox Software).

It may be discontinued by Microsoft (it does not fit into the .NET environment) but the VFP community is alive and well (see Visual Foxpro Wiki and ProFox). There are thousands of Visual FoxPro applications in use. It is a rich, versatile language with excellent data handling capabilities both for native data and remote data sources (SQL Server, Oracle etc.). It was originally written by Dave Fulton of Ashton Tate who sold Fox Software to Microsoft who saw Fox supplanting their own desktop database application (Access).
