The '''Vox''' programming language is multi-purpose language, designed to be used in embedded environments, as well as for general purposes.

Vox started out as a fork of the [[Category:Squirrel|Squirrel]] language, but has moved in a different direction ever since. While Squirrel is mostly intended to be used in embedding, Vox tries to tackle this problem by providing a larger standard library (based on [[Boost]]), extended object manipulation (borrowing many ideas from languages like [[Python]]), and an <code>import</code> function, that is largely borrowed from [[Lua]] (only the idea, not the code). Despite that, Vox is ''not'' compatible with Squirrel.
