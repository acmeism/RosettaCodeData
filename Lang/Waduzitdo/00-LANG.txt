Waduzitdo is a programming language created by Larry Kheriaty and published in the popular computer culture magazine BYTE in 1978. It very closely resembles [[PILOT]], but is even more simplified and has been proven to not be Turing complete. It appears to have been created as an attempt to create an extremely small compiler, as well as being a good language for demonstrating basic functions; the language only has eight commands, which demonstrate input and output, along with basic pattern-matching and decision-making. The language gets its name from the fact that it was designed for demonstrating a computer to people who had never used one before who are asking "What does it do?"
