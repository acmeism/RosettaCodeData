{{stub}}{{language|WebAssembly}}
WebAssembly or wasm is a low-level bytecode format for in-browser client-side scripting that is more efficient than JavaScript, from which it evolved. 
WebAssembly is a portable stack machine which is designed to be faster to parse than JavaScript, as well as faster to execute.
Its initial aim is to support compilation from C and C++, though other source languages such as Rust are also supported.
