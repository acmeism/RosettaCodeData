Wrapl is a dynamic programming language designed for various programming tasks including rapid prototyping, scripts and [[GUI]] application development.

The key features in Wrapl include:
*  [[Object-oriented]]: Every value in Wrapl is an object with a type which is known at [[run time]]. The types form a hierarchy with [[multiple inheritance]].
* Multiple-dispatch: Method dispatch in Wrapl depends on the types and values of all of their arguments.
* Pass-by-reference: Wrapl allows variables to be passed by reference to other functions.
* Functional [[closures]]: Functions in Wrapl are first-class objects which may passed to other functions or stored in variables. Functions can both read and write variables declared in surrounding scopes.
* Goal-directed: Every expression in Wrapl can produce 0, 1, or more values. An expression which can produce more than 1 value may be resumed to produce its next value.
