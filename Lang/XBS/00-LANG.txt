{{language|XBS}}

== What is XBS? ==
XBS is an interpreted language written in [[JavaScript]]. XBS has similarities to JavaScript and Python, as well as some other languages. XBS can be used for any web page with the correct library.

----

== Details ==

XBS has a github page and is currently open-sourced. The github page has a wiki for the documentation; but just know, this language still isn't done. It has most features a programming language has, except for some minor details that I need to fix.

----

== Code Examples ==

Variable declaration

<lang xbs>set x = "Hello, world!";
log(x)</lang>

Functions

<lang xbs>func FirstFunction(a,b){
    send a+b; #Add a and b
}
log(FirstFunction(1,2));</lang>
