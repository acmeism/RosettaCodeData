== What is XBS? ==

XBS is an interpreted language written in [[JavaScript]]. The language does not have its own sandbox, and relies on methods passed down from JavaScript. XBS was created originally to help its creator understand how to create a basic programming language, and later branched out its syntax in creative ways.
