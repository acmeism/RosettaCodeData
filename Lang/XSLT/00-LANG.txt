'''XSLT''', which stands for '''Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations''', is a domain specific [[functional programming|functional]] language for extracting data from and transforming [[XML]] documents. The language itself uses [[XML]] syntax. It is defined in three pieces:
# '''Extensible Stylesheet Language''' (XSL) is the base language
# '''XPath''' is the expression language used within many of the attributes to address portions of the document and manipulate values
# '''Formatting Objects''' (FO) is an extension for providing page layout and presentation, which has a similar model to PDF
