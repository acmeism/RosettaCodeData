'''''x''Talk''' (pronounced "cross-talk") is the language family started by [[HyperTalk]], the scripting language of [[Apple Computer]]'s [[HyperCard]] application for [[Mac OS]] Classic operating systems. Aimed at novice programmers, xTalk languages are noted for an English-like syntax. Its modern descendants include [[AppleScript]] (more SK8Script/LISP based), [[LiveCode]]/[[OpenXTalk]], and [[SenseTalk]].
