'''[https://yamlscript.org YS (aka YAMLScript)]''' is a new programming language that uses [https://yaml.org/ YAML] as its syntax. It is a complete, functional, general purpose language, but can also be easily embedded in YAML files to make them dynamic at load time. Most existing YAML files and all JSON files are already valid YS programs.

You can learn YS for free (with help from experienced mentors) at [https://exercism.org/tracks/yamlscript Exercism].

YS has a compiler/interpreter CLI program called <code>[https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases ys]</code> and is also available in several programming languages as a binding module to the <code>[https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases libyamlscript.so]</code> shared library:

* [https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/clj-yamlscript Clojure]
* [https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript-go Go]
