[http://zoea.co.uk Zoea Visual] is a simple visual programming language built on top of the [[Zoea]] composable inductive programming language. Zoea Visual programs consist of one or more data flow diagrams comprising static data values and data flow connectors called dependencies. Each diagram in Zoea Visual corresponds to a functional test case with any number of inputs and outputs.

Zoea Visual diagrams can include any number of intermediate (derived) values as well as static reference data elements. Diagrams can also include subsidiary test cases which represent embedded sub-programs that are also expressed as diagrams, and these can form a hierarchy. Existing Zoea and Zoea Visual programs can also be composed to form larger programs.

The Zoea compiler automatically translates Zoea Visual diagrams into code that is interpreted by the Zoea virtual machine.
