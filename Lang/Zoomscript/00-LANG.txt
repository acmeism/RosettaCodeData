Zoomscript is a programming language and the name of [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/349785253/ its official IDE] (which also works as a text editor) that runs on top of [[Scratch]], originally released on January 5th, 2020 by [[Scratch]] user [https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-llll- -llll-], and last updated on January 12th, 2020. It is officially described as a simple programming language with a syntax inspired by [[JavaScript]] and [[Bash]], but with powerful features such as, but not limited to, pseudotypes, dynamic packages, syntax and error highlighting.

For each example, a version to type and a "compiled" version (the program is not actually compiled, "compiled" programs are essentially just pieces of code modified so they can be imported) to import is provided so the code can be entered into the official IDE in any possible way without having to convert between one or the other.

==Version history==
In each "build" number, the first part is the last two digits of the year, the second part is the number of the month, and the third part is the day of the month. For instance, in build 20108, which was released on January 8th, 2020, the first part is "20", which means 2020, the second part is "1", which means January, and the third part is "08", which means the 8th of the month.
