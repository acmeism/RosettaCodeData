Problem: You have 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
You make 100 [[task feature::Rosetta Code:multiple passes|passes]] by the doors.
The first time through, you visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it). The second time you only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6, ...).
The third time, every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc, until you only visit the 100th door.

Question: What state are the doors in after the last pass? Which are open, which are closed? [http://www.techinterview.org/Puzzles/fog0000000079.html]

'''[[task feature::Rosetta Code:extra credit|Alternate]]:'''
As noted in this page's [[Talk:100 doors|discussion page]], the only doors that remain open are whose numbers are perfect squares of integers.
Opening only those doors is an [[task feature::Rosetta Code:optimization|optimization]] that may also be expressed.
