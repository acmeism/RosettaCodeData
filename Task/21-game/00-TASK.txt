'''21''' is a two player game, the game is played by choosing 
a number ('''1''', '''2''', or '''3''')  to be added to the ''running&nbsp;total''.

The game is won by the player whose chosen number causes the ''running&nbsp;total''
to reach ''exactly''&nbsp;'''21'''.

The ''running total'' starts at zero. 
One player will be the computer.
 
Players alternate supplying a number to be added to the ''running&nbsp;total''.

::* display the ''running&nbsp;total'', 
::* provide a mechanism for the player to quit/exit/halt/stop/close the program,
