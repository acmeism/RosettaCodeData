The [[wp:24 Game|24 Game]] tests one's mental arithmetic.

Write a program that [[task feature::Rosetta Code:randomness|randomly]] chooses and [[task feature::Rosetta Code:user output|displays]] four digits, each from one to nine, with repetitions allowed. The program should prompt for the player to enter an arithmetic expression using ''just'' those, and ''all'' of those four digits. The program should ''check'' then [[task feature::Rosetta Code:parsing|evaluate the expression]]. The goal is for the player to [[task feature::Rosetta Code:user input|enter]] an expression that evaluates to '''24'''.
* Only multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction operators/functions are allowed.
* Division should use floating point or rational arithmetic, etc, to preserve remainders.
* Brackets are allowed, if using an infix expression evaluator.
* Forming multiple digit numbers from the supplied digits is ''disallowed''. (So an answer of 12+12 when given 1, 2, 2, and 1 is wrong).
* The order of the digits when given does not have to be preserved.

Note:
* The type of expression evaluator used is not mandated. An [[wp:Reverse Polish notation|RPN]] evaluator is equally acceptable for example.
* The task is not for the program to generate the expression, or test whether an expression is even possible.
