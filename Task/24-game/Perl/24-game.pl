The 24 Game

Given any four digits in the range 1 to 9, which may have repetitions,
Using just the +, -, *, and / operators; and the possible use of
parentheses, (), show how to make an answer of 24.

An answer of "q" or EOF will quit the game.
A blank answer will generate a new set of four digits.
Otherwise you are repeatedly asked for an expression until it evaluates to 24.

Note: you cannot form multiple digit numbers from the supplied digits,
so an answer of 12+12 when given 1, 2, 2, and 1 would not be allowed.
