In this puzzle, write code to print out the entire "99 bottles of beer on the wall" song. For those who do not know the song, the lyrics follow this form:
 X bottles of beer on the wall
 X bottles of beer
 Take one down, pass it around
 X-1 bottles of beer on the wall

 X-1 bottles of beer on the wall
 ...
 Take one down, pass it around
 0 bottles of beer on the wall
Where X and X-1 are replaced by numbers of course. Grammatical support for "1 bottle of beer" is optional. As with any puzzle, try to do it in as creative/concise/comical a way as possible (simple, obvious solutions allowed, too).
