Beer Hall is a room.

When play begins:
	repeat with iteration running from 1 to 99:
		let N be 100 - iteration;
		say "[N] bottle[s] of beer on the wall[line break]";
		say "[N] bottle[s] of beer[line break]";
		say "Take one down, pass it around[line break]";
		say "[N - 1] bottle[s] of beer on the wall[paragraph break]";
	end the story.
