;;;Actually, the solution is same as that of many other Lisp dialects here
(+ (read) (read))
;;Yes, it is neat but not strong, error prone actually. Other than this walkaround, if you dislike fetching a line in string format then parse the chars one by one by hand or byte by byte from stdin, you can use one read and do the work, with the price of typing (1 2) instead of 1 2 at the prompt since read would treat the input as a symbolic expression. So.,.there is sadly no easy way like scanf and %d %d in c unless one is willing to type ()s!
