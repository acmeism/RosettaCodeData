You are given a collection of ABC blocks. Just like the ones you had when you were a kid. There are twenty blocks with two letters on each block. You are guaranteed to have a complete alphabet amongst all sides of the blocks. The sample blocks are:

:((B O)
: (X K)
: (D Q)
: (C P)
: (N A)
: (G T)
: (R E)
: (T G)
: (Q D)
: (F S)
: (J W)
: (H U)
: (V I)
: (A N)
: (O B)
: (E R)
: (F S)
: (L Y)
: (P C)
: (Z M))

The goal of this task is to write a function that takes a string and can determine whether you can spell the word with the given collection of blocks.
The rules are simple:

#Once a letter on a block is used that block cannot be used again
#The function should be case-insensitive
# Show your output on this page for the following words:

;Example:

<lang python>
    >>> can_make_word("A")
    True
    >>> can_make_word("BARK")
    True
    >>> can_make_word("BOOK")
    False
    >>> can_make_word("TREAT")
    True
    >>> can_make_word("COMMON")
    False
    >>> can_make_word("SQUAD")
    True
    >>> can_make_word("CONFUSE")
    True
</lang>
