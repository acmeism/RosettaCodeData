The [http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/algebra/primality_v6.pdf AKS algorithm] for testing whether a number is prime is a
polynomial-time algorithm based on an elementary theorem about Pascal triangles.

The theorem on which the test is based can be stated as follows:

* a number <math>p</math> is prime if and only if all the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of
: <math>(x-1)^p - (x^p - 1)</math>
are divisible by <math>p</math>.

For example, trying <math>p=3</math>:

: <math>(x-1)^3 - (x^3 - 1)
= (x^3 -3x^2 +3x -1) - (x^3 - 1)
= -3x^2 +3x
</math>
:And all the coefficients are divisible by 3 so 3 is prime.

;The task:
# Create a function/subroutine/method that given p generates the coefficients of the expanded polynomial representation of <math>(x-1)^p</math>.
# Use the function to show here the polynomial expansions of <math>(x-1)^p</math> for p in the range 0 to at least 7, inclusive.
# Use the previous function in creating another function that when given p  returns whether p is prime using the theorem.
# Use your test to generate a list of all primes ''under'' 35.
# '''As a stretch goal''', generate all primes under 50 (Needs greater than 31 bit integers).

;Note:
The task given here is related to the elementary theorem, not the actual AKS algorithm.  Using the elementary theorem directly as a way of testing for primes is interesting as an exercise but impractical.
