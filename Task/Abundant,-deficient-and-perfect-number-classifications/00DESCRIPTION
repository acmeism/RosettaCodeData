These define three classifications of positive integers based on their [[Proper divisors|proper divisors]].

Let P(n) be the sum of the proper divisors of n, where the proper divisors of n are all positive divisors of n other than n itself.
* if <code>P(n) <  n </code> then n is classed as '''deficient''' ([https://oeis.org/A005100 OEIS A005100]).
* if <code>P(n) == n</code> then n is classed as '''perfect''' ([https://oeis.org/A000396 OEIS A000396]).
* if <code>P(n) >  n </code> then n is classed as '''abundant''' ([https://oeis.org/A005101 OEIS A005101]).

Example: 6 has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 so 6 is classed as a perfect number.

;Task:
Calculate how many of the integers 1 to 20,000 inclusive are in each of the three classes and show the result here.
