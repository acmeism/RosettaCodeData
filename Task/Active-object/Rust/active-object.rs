/// (shared-memory concurrency) to hold the result of the integration.
///
/// Note that these are not the only options here--there are many, many ways you can deal with
/// concurrent access.  But when in doubt, a plain old `Mutex` is often a good bet.  For example,
/// this might look like a good situation for a `RwLock`--after all, there's no reason for a read
/// in the main task to block writes.  Unfortunately, unless you have significantly more reads than
/// writes (which is certainly not the case here), a `Mutex` will usually outperform a `RwLock`.

/// order to be able to actually do math with them we say that the type parameter `S` (the result
/// of the function being integrated) must yield `T` (the type of the integrated value) when
/// multiplied by `f64`.  We could possibly replace `f64` with a generic as well, but it would make
/// things a bit more complex.

                            // to release the lock is by letting the MutexGuard fall out of scope,
                            // so it's impossible to access the data incorrectly.  There are some
                            // additional subtleties around the actual implementation, but that's
