Demonstrate how to dynamically add variables to an object (a class instance) at runtime.

This is useful when the methods/variables of an instance are based on a data file that isn't available until runtime.  Hal Fulton gives an example of creating an OO CSV parser at [http://www.devsource.com/article2/0,1759,1928562,00.asp An Exercise in Metaprogramming with Ruby].  This is referred to as "monkeypatching" by Pythonistas and some others.
