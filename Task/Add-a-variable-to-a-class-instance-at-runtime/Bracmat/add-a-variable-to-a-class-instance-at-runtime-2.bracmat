Object as originally created:
(object=
=(aMember=) (aMethod=.!(its.aMember)));

Object with additional member and method and with 'aMember' already set to some interesting value:
(object=

=   (anotherMember=)
    (anotherMethod=.!(its.anotherMember))
    (aMember=A value)
    (aMethod=.!(its.aMember)));

Call both methods and output their return values.
aMember contains: A value
anotherMember contains: some other value
