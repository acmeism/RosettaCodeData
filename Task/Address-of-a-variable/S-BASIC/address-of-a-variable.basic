  The LOCATION statement (with its somewhat counter-
  intuitive syntax) is used to obtain the address
  of a variable.  A variable may be placed at a
  particular memory address by declaring it as BASED and
  then positioning it at run-time using the BASE..AT
  statement. Most often this is done to access the values
  stored in operating system variables and structures,
  though it has other uses as well.
end

var i, address_of_i = integer
based k = integer

location var address_of_i = i
print "The variable i is stored at "; hex$(address_of_i)
base k at address_of_i
i = 12345
print "i ="; i
print "k ="; k       rem - same as i

end
