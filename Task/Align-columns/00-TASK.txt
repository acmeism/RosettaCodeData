Given a text file of many lines, where fields within a line 
are delineated by a single 'dollar' character, write a program
that aligns each column of fields by ensuring that words in each 
column are separated by at least one space.
Further, allow for each word in a column to be either left 
justified, right justified, or center justified within its column.

<br clear=all>Use the following text to test your programs:
<pre>Given$a$text$file$of$many$lines,$where$fields$within$a$line$
are$delineated$by$a$single$'dollar'$character,$write$a$program
that$aligns$each$column$of$fields$by$ensuring$that$words$in$each$
column$are$separated$by$at$least$one$space.
Further,$allow$for$each$word$in$a$column$to$be$either$left$
justified,$right$justified,$or$center$justified$within$its$column.</pre>


Note that:
# &nbsp; The example input texts lines may, or may not, have trailing dollar characters.
# &nbsp; All columns should share the same alignment.
# &nbsp; Consecutive space characters produced adjacent to the end of lines are insignificant for the purposes of the task.
# &nbsp; Output text will be viewed in a mono-spaced font on a plain text editor or basic terminal.
# &nbsp; The minimum space between columns should be computed from the text and not hard-coded.
# &nbsp; It is ''not'' a requirement to add separating characters between or around columns.
