The Almkvist-Giullera formula for calculating <math>\frac{1}{\pi^2}</math> is based on the Calabi-Yau
differential equations of order 4 and 5, &nbsp; which were originally used to describe certain manifolds
in string theory. 


The formula is:
:<math>\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}=32 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(6n)!}{3 \cdot n!^{6}}(532n^{2}+126n+9)\frac{1}{10^{6n+3}}</math>


This formula can be used to calculate the constant <math>\frac{1}{\pi^2}</math>, &nbsp; and thus to calculate <math>\pi</math>.

Note that, because the product of all terms but the power of 1000 can be calculated as an integer,
the terms in the series can be separated into a large integer term:

:<math>\frac{32(6n)!}{3 \cdot n!^{6}}(532n^{2}+126n+9)</math>

multiplied by a negative integer power of 10:

:<math>10^{-(6n + 3)}</math>


;Task:
:* Print the integer portions (the starred formula, which is without the power of 1000 divisor) of the first 10 terms of the series.
:* Use the complete formula to calculate and print <math>\pi</math> to 70 decimal digits of precision.
