A &nbsp; [[wp:Almost prime|k-Almost-prime]] &nbsp; is a natural number &nbsp; <math>n</math> &nbsp; that is the product of &nbsp; <math>k</math> &nbsp; (possibly identical) primes.


;Example:
1-almost-primes,     &nbsp; where &nbsp; <math>k=1</math>, &nbsp; are the prime numbers themselves.
<br>2-almost-primes, &nbsp; where &nbsp; <math>k=2</math>, &nbsp; are the &nbsp; [[Semiprime|semiprimes]].


;Task:
Write a function/method/subroutine/... that generates k-almost primes and use it to create a table here of the first ten members of k-Almost primes for &nbsp; <math>1 \le K \le 5</math>.
