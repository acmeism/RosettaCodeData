Two or more words are said to be [[Anagrams|anagrams]] if they have the same characters, but in a different order. 

By analogy with [[Permutations/Derangements|derangements]] we define a  ''deranged anagram'' as two words with the same characters, but in which the same character does ''not'' appear in the same position in both words.

;Task

Use the word list at [http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt unixdict] to find and display the longest deranged anagram.
