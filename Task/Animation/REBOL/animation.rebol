; This next bit specifies the GUI panel. The window will have a
; gradient backdrop, over which will be composited the text, in a
; monospaced font with a drop-shadow. A timer (the 'rate' bit) is set
; to update 24 times per second. The 'engage' function in the 'feel'
; block listens for events on the text face. Time events update the
; animation and mouse-down change the animation's direction.
