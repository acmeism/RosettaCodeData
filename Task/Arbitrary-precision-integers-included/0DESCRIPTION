Using the in-built capabilities of your language, calculate the integer value of:

::<math>5^{4^{3^2}}</math>

*  Confirm that the first and last twenty digits of the answer are: <code>62060698786608744707...92256259918212890625</code>
*  Find and show the number of decimal digits in the answer.

<small>Note: <ul><li>Do not submit an ''implementation'' of [[wp:arbitrary precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision arithmetic]]. The intention is to show the capabilities of the language as supplied. If a language has a [[Talk:Arbitrary-precision integers (included)#Use of external libraries|single, overwhelming, library]] of varied modules that is endorsed by its home site – such as [[CPAN]] for Perl or [[Boost]] for C++ – then that ''may'' be used instead.
</li><li>Strictly speaking, this should not be solved by fixed-precision numeric libraries where the precision has to be manually set to a large value; although if this is the '''only''' recourse then it may be used with a note explaining that the precision must be set manually to a large enough value.</li></ul></small>
