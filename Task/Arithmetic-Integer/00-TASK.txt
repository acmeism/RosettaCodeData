{{basic data operation}} 
;Task:
Get two integers from the user, &nbsp;  and then (for those two integers), display their:
::::* &nbsp; sum 
::::* &nbsp; difference 
::::* &nbsp; product 
::::* &nbsp; integer quotient
::::* &nbsp; remainder 
::::* &nbsp; exponentiation &nbsp; (if the operator exists) 

<br>
Don't include error handling. 

For quotient, indicate how it rounds &nbsp; (e.g. towards zero, towards negative infinity, etc.). 

For remainder, indicate whether its sign matches the sign of the first operand or of the second operand, if they are different.
<br><br>

Bonus: Include an example of the integer `divmod` operator. For example: as in [[#Haskell]], [[#Python]] and [[#ALGOL 68]]
