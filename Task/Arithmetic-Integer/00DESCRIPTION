{{basic data operation}} [[Category:Simple]]
Get two integers from the user, and then output the sum, difference, product, integer quotient and remainder of those numbers.
Don't include error handling.
For quotient, indicate how it rounds (e.g. towards 0, towards negative infinity, etc.).
For remainder, indicate whether its sign matches the sign of the first operand or of the second operand, if they are different.

Also include the exponentiation operator if one exists.
