Create a program which parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions.

;Requirements:
* An [[wp:Abstract_syntax_tree|abstract-syntax tree]] (AST) for the expression must be created from parsing the input.
* The AST must be used in evaluation, also, so the input may not be directly evaluated (e.g. by calling eval or a similar language feature.)
* The expression will be a string or list of symbols like "(1+3)*7".
* The four symbols + - * / must be supported as binary operators with conventional precedence rules.
* Precedence-control parentheses must also be supported.

;Note:
For those who don't remember, mathematical precedence is as follows:
* Parentheses
* Multiplication/Division (left to right)
* Addition/Subtraction (left to right)

* [[Parsing/RPN to infix conversion]].
