LDX #2            ;load the 1st (zero-indexed) WORD from the array (which is why this is 2 not 1)
LDA wordArray,X   ;evaluates to LDA #$EF
STA $00           ;store in a zero page temporary variable
INX               ;point X to the high byte
LDA wordArray,X   ;evaluates to LDA #$BE
STA $01           ;store in a different zero page temporary variable. If your word data is a pointer you want to dereference,
                  ;you'll need to store the low byte in $nn and the high byte in $nn+1 like I did here.
