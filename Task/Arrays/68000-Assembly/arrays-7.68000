myArray equ $240000

;insert a new element into the 2nd slot and push everything behind it back.

LEA myArray,A0     ;load the base address of the array into A0
MOVE.W #2,D0       ;offset into 2nd slot
LSL.W #2,D0        ;this array is intended for 32-bit values.
MOVE.L #46,D1      ;this is our new element.



MOVE.L (A0,D0),(4,A0,D0) ;store the 2nd element into the 3rd slot
ADDA.L #4,A0             ;increment to next slot.
MOVE.L (A0,D0),(4,A0,D0) ;store the 3nd element into the 4th slot
ADDA.L #4,A0             ;increment to next slot.
MOVE.L (A0,D0),(4,A0,D0) ;store the 4th element into the 5th slot
ADDA.L #4,A0             ;increment to next slot.
MOVE.L (A0,D0),(4,A0,D0) ;store the 5th element into the 6th slot

LEA myArray,A0           ;restore the base address
MOVE.L D1,(A0,D0)        ;store the new 2nd element over the 2nd slot.

;for a larger array we can use the following loop:
MOVE.W #3,D2       ;array length minus starting offset minus 1

LOOP:
MOVE.L (A0,D0),(4,A0,D0)
ADDA.L #4,A0
DBRA D2,LOOP
