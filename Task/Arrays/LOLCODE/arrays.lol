HAI 1.4
BTW declaring array
I HAS A array ITZ A BUKKIT
BTW store values in array
array HAS A one ITZ 1
array HAS A two ITZ 2
array HAS A three ITZ 3
array HAS A string ITZ "MEOW"
OBTW
there is no way to get an element of an array at a specified index in LOLCODE
therefore, you can't really iterate through an array
TLDR
BTW get the element of array
VISIBLE array'Z one
VISIBLE array'Z two
VISIBLE array'Z three
VISIBLE array'Z string
KTHXBYE
