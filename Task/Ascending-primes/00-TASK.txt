Generate and show all primes with strictly ascending decimal digits.

Aside: Try solving without peeking at existing solutions. I had a weird idea for generating
a prime sieve faster, which needless to say didn't pan out. The solution may be p(r)etty trivial
but generating them quickly is at least mildly interesting.
Tip: filtering all 7,027,260 primes below 123,456,789 probably won't kill you, but there is
at least one significantly better and much faster way, needing a mere 511 odd/prime tests.
