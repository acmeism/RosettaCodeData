Hash Bar is a room.

When play begins:
	let R be a various-to-one relation of texts to numbers;
	[initialize the relation]
	now R relates "foo" to 12;
	now R relates "bar" to 34;
	now R relates "baz" to 56;
	[check values]
	if R relates "foo" to 12, say "good.";
	if R does not relate "bar" to 56, say "good.";
	[retrieve values]
	let V be the number that "baz" relates to by R;
	say "'baz' => [V].";
	end the story.
