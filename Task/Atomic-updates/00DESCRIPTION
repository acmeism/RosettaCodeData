;Task:
Define a data type consisting of a fixed number of 'buckets', each containing a nonnegative integer value, which supports operations to:
# get the current value of any bucket
# remove a specified amount from one specified bucket and add it to another, preserving the total of all bucket values, and [[wp:Clamping (graphics)|clamping]] the transferred amount to ensure the values remain non-negative

----

In order to exercise this data type, create one set of buckets, and start three concurrent tasks:
# As often as possible, pick two buckets and make their values closer to equal.
# As often as possible, pick two buckets and arbitrarily redistribute their values.
# At whatever rate is convenient, display (by any means) the total value and, optionally, the individual values of each bucket.

<br>
The display task need not be explicit; use of e.g. a debugger or trace tool is acceptable provided it is simple to set up to provide the display.

----

This task is intended as an exercise in ''atomic'' operations. &nbsp; The sum of the bucket values must be preserved even if the two tasks attempt to perform transfers simultaneously, and a straightforward solution is to ensure that at any time, only one transfer is actually occurring — that the transfer operation is ''atomic''.
