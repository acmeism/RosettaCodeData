A number is an &nbsp; ''attractive number'' &nbsp; if the number of its prime factors (whether distinct or not) is also prime.


;Example:
The number &nbsp; '''20''', &nbsp; whose prime decomposition is &nbsp; '''2 &times; 2 &times; 5''', &nbsp; is an &nbsp; ''attractive number'' &nbsp; because the number of its prime factors &nbsp; ('''3''') &nbsp; is also prime.


;Task:
Show sequence items up to &nbsp; '''120'''.
