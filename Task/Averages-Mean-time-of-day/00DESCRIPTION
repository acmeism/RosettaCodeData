A particular activity of bats occurs at these times of the day:
:<tt>23:00:17</tt>, <tt>23:40:20</tt>, <tt>00:12:45</tt>, <tt>00:17:19</tt>

Using the idea that there are twenty-four hours in a day,
which is analogous to there being 360 degrees in a circle,
map times of day to and from angles;
and using the ideas of [[Averages/Mean angle]]
compute and show the average time of the nocturnal activity
to an accuracy of one second of time.
