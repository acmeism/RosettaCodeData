;Task

Write a program to find the [[wp:Mode (statistics)|mode]] value of a collection. 

The case where the collection is empty may be ignored. Care must be taken to handle the case where the mode is non-unique.

If it is not appropriate or possible to support a general collection, use a vector (array), if possible. If it is not appropriate or possible to support an unspecified value type, use integers.
