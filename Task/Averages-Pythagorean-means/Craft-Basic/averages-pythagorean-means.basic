define bxsum = 1, sum = 0, sum1i = 0
define average = 0, geometric = 0, harmonic = 0

for i = 1 to 10

	let sum = sum + i
	let bxsum = bxsum * i
	let sum1i = sum1i + (1 / i)

next i

let average = sum / 10
let geometric = bxsum ^ (1 / 10)
let harmonic = 10 / sum1i

print "arithmetic mean: ", average

print "harmonic mean: ", harmonic

if average >= geometric and geometric >= harmonic then

	print "true"
