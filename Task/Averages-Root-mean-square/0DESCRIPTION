Compute the [[wp:Root mean square|Root mean square]] of the numbers 1..10.

The root mean square is also known by its initial RMS (or rms), and as the '''quadratic mean'''.

The RMS is calculated as the mean of the squares of the numbers, square-rooted:
: <math>x_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt {{{x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 + \cdots + {x_n}^2} \over n}. </math>
