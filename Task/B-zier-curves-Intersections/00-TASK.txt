You are given two planar quadratic [[wp:Bézier_curve|Bézier curves]], having control points <math>(-1,0), (0,10), (1,0)</math> and <math>(2,1), (-8,2), (2,3)</math>, respectively. They are parabolas intersecting at four points, as shown in the following diagram:


::[[File:Figure-1 for bezier intersection.png|none|alt=Two intersecting parabolas and their control points.]]


The task is to write a program that finds all four intersection points and prints their <math>(x,y)</math> coordinates. You may use any algorithm you know of or can think of, including any of those that others have used.
