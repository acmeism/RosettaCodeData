See [[Base64 encode data]]. 

Now write a program that takes the output of the [[Base64 encode data]] task as input and regenerate the original file. 

When working on the VBA implementation I found several 'solutions' on the net, including one from the software maker himself, that showed output with incorrect padding. Obviously with incorrect padding in the output you can not decode correctly to the original file again.
