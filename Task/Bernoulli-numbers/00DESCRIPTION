[[wp:Bernoulli number|Bernoulli numbers]] are used in some series expansions of several functions (trigonometric, hyperbolic, gamma, etc.), and are extremely important in number theory and analysis. Note that there are two definitions of Bernoulli numbers; this task will be using the modern usage (as per the National Institute of Standards and Technology convention). The <math>n</math>'th Bernoulli number is expressed as <span style="font-family:serif">'''B'''<sub>''n''</sub></span>.

;Task
* show the Bernoulli numbers <span style="font-family:serif">'''B'''<sub>0</sub></span> through <span style="font-family:serif">'''B'''<sub>60</sub></span>, suppressing all output of values which are equal to zero. (Other than <span style="font-family:serif">'''B'''<sub>1</sub></span>, all odd Bernoulli numbers have a value of 0 (zero).
* express the numbers as fractions (most are improper fractions).
** fractions should be reduced.
** index each number in some way so that it can be discerned which number is being displayed.
** align the solidi (<tt>/</tt>) if used (extra credit).

;An algorithm
The Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm for the "second Bernoulli numbers" as taken from [[wp:Bernoulli_number#Algorithmic_description|wikipedia]] is as follows:

  '''for''' ''m'' '''from''' 0 '''by''' 1 '''to''' ''n'' '''do'''
     ''A''[''m''] ← 1/(''m''+1)
     '''for''' ''j'' '''from''' ''m'' '''by''' -1 '''to''' 1 '''do'''
       ''A''[''j''-1] ← ''j''×(''A''[''j''-1] - ''A''[''j''])
   '''return''' ''A''[0] (which is ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>)
