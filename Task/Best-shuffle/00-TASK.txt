;Task:
Shuffle the characters of a string in such a way that as many of the character values are in a different position as possible. 

A shuffle that produces a randomized result among the best choices is to be preferred. A deterministic approach that produces the same sequence every time is acceptable as an alternative.

Display the result as follows: 

 original string, shuffled string, (score) 

The score gives the number of positions whose character value did ''not'' change. 


;Example:
 tree, eetr, (0)


;Test cases:
 abracadabra
 seesaw
 elk
 grrrrrr
 up
 a
