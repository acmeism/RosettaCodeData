Shuffle the characters of a string in such a way that as many of the character values are in a different position as possible. Print the result as follows: original string, shuffled string, (score). The score gives the number of positions whose character value did ''not'' change.

For example: <code>tree, eetr, (0)</code>

A shuffle that produces a randomized result among the best choices is to be preferred. A deterministic approach that produces the same sequence every time is acceptable as an alternative.

The words to test with are: <code>abracadabra</code>, <code>seesaw</code>, <code>elk</code>, <code>grrrrrr</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>a</code>
