;Task:
Create and display the sequence of binary digits for a given &nbsp; [[wp:Natural number|non-negative integer]].

    The decimal value &nbsp;    '''5''' &nbsp; should produce an output of &nbsp;             '''101'''
    The decimal value &nbsp;   '''50''' &nbsp; should produce an output of &nbsp;          '''110010'''
    The decimal value &nbsp; '''9000''' &nbsp; should produce an output of &nbsp;  '''10001100101000'''

The results can be achieved using built-in radix functions within the language &nbsp; (if these are available), &nbsp; or alternatively a user defined function can be used. 

The output produced should consist just of the binary digits of each number followed by a &nbsp; ''newline''. 

There should be no other whitespace, radix or sign markers in the produced output, and [[wp:Leading zero|leading zeros]] should not appear in the results.
