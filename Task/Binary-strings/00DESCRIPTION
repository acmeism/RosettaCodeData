Many languages have powerful and useful ('''binary safe''') [[wp:String (computer science)|string]] [[wp:Comparison of programming languages (string functions)|manipulation functions]], while others don't, making it harder for these languages to accomplish some tasks.
This task is about creating functions to handle ''binary'' strings (strings made of arbitrary bytes, i.e. ''byte strings'' according to Wikipedia) for those languages that don't have built-in support for them. If your language of choice does have this built-in support, show a possible alternative implementation for the ''functions'' or ''abilities'' already provided by the language.
In particular the functions you need to create are:
* String creation and destruction (when needed and if there's no [[garbage collection]] or similar mechanism)
* String assignment
* String comparison
* String cloning and copying
* Check if a string is empty
* Append a byte to a string
* Extract a substring from a string
* Replace every occurrence of a byte (or a string) in a string with another string
* Join strings

Possible contexts of use: compression algorithms (like [[LZW compression]]), L-systems (manipulation of symbols), many more.
