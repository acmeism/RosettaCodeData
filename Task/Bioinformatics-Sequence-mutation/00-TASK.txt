;Task:
Given a string of characters A, C, G, and T representing a DNA sequence write a routine to mutate the sequence, (string) by:
# Choosing a random base position in the sequence.
# Mutate the sequence by  doing one of either:
## '''S'''wap the base at that position by changing it to one of A, C, G, or T. (which has a chance of swapping the base for the same base)
## '''D'''elete the chosen base at the position.
## '''I'''nsert another base randomly chosen from A,C, G, or T into the sequence at that position.
# Randomly generate a test DNA sequence of at least 200 bases
# "Pretty print" the sequence and a count of its size, and the count of each base in the sequence
# Mutate the sequence ten times.
# "Pretty print" the sequence after all mutations, and a count of its size, and the count of each base in the sequence.

;Extra credit:
* Give more information on the individual mutations applied.
* Allow mutations to be weighted and/or chosen.
