Implement a [[wp:flood fill|flood fill]]. 

A flood fill is a way of filling an area using ''color banks'' to define the contained area or a ''target color'' which "determines" the area (the ''valley'' that can be flooded; Wikipedia uses the term ''target color''). It works almost like a water flooding from a point towards the banks (or: inside the valley): if there's a hole in the banks, the flood is not contained and all the image (or all the "connected valleys") get filled.

To accomplish the task, you need to implement just one of the possible algorithms (examples are on [[wp:flood fill|Wikipedia]]). Variations on the ''theme'' are allowed (e.g. adding a tolerance parameter or argument for color-matching of the ''banks'' or ''target'' color).

'''Testing''': the basic algorithm is not suitable for ''truecolor'' images; a possible test image is the one shown on the right box; you can try to fill the white area, or the black inner circle.
