Extend the basic bitmap storage defined [[Basic_bitmap_storage|on this page]] to support dealing with image histograms. The image histogram contains for each luminance the count of image pixels having this luminance. Choosing a histogram representation take care about the data type used for the counts. It must have range of at least 0..NxM, where N is the image width and M is the image height.

'''Test task'''

Histogram is useful for many image processing operations. As an example, use it to convert an image into black and white art. The method works as follows:
* Convert image to grayscale;
* Compute the histogram
* Find the median: defined as the luminance such that the image has an approximately equal number of pixels with lesser and greater luminance.
* Replace each pixel of luminance lesser than the median to black, and others to white.
Use [[read ppm file | read]]/[[write ppm file]], and [[grayscale image]] solutions.
