Using the data storage type defined [[Basic_bitmap_storage|on this page]] for raster images, read an image from a PPM file (binary P6 prefered).
(Read [[wp:Netpbm_format|the definition of PPM file]] on Wikipedia.)

'''Task''': Use [[write ppm file]] solution and [[grayscale image]] solution with this one in order to convert a color image to grayscale one.
