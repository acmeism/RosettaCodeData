This task is the ''opposite'' of the [[PPM conversion through a pipe]]. In this task, using a delegate tool (like '''cjpeg''', one of the netpbm package, or '''convert''' of the ImageMagick package) we read an image file and load it into the data storage type [[Basic bitmap storage|defined here]]. We can also use the code from [[Read ppm file]], so that we can use PPM format like a (natural) bridge between the foreign image format and our simple data storage.
