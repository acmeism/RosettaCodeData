Consider a simplified CSV format where all rows are separated by a newline 
and all columns are separated by commas. 

No commas are allowed as field data, but the data may contain 
other characters and character sequences that would 
normally be &nbsp; ''escaped'' &nbsp; when converted to HTML


;Task:
Create a function that takes a string representation of the CSV data
and returns a text string of an HTML table representing the CSV data. 

Use the following  data as the CSV text to convert, and show your output.
: Character,Speech
: The multitude,The messiah! Show us the messiah!
: Brians mother,<nowiki><angry>Now you listen here! He's not the messiah; he's a very naughty boy! Now go away!</angry></nowiki>
: The multitude,Who are you?
: Brians mother,I'm his mother; that's who!
: The multitude,Behold his mother! Behold his mother!


;Extra credit:
''Optionally'' allow special formatting for the first row of the table as if it is the tables header row 
(via <nowiki><thead></nowiki> preferably; CSS if you must).
