Consider a simplified CSV format where all rows are separated by a
newline and all columns are separated by commas. No commas are
allowed as field data, but the data may contain other characters
and character sequences that would normally be escaped when
converted to HTML

The task is to create a function that takes a string representation of the CSV data
and returns a text string of an HTML table representing the CSV data. Use the following
data as the CSV text to convert, and show your output.
:Character,Speech
:The multitude,The messiah! Show us the messiah!
:Brians mother,<nowiki><angry>Now you listen here! He's not the messiah; he's a very naughty boy! Now go away!</angry></nowiki>
:The multitude,Who are you?
:Brians mother,I'm his mother; that's who!
:The multitude,Behold his mother! Behold his mother!

For extra credit, ''optionally'' allow special formatting for the
first row of the table as if it is the tables header row (via <nowiki><thead></nowiki> preferably; CSS if you must).
