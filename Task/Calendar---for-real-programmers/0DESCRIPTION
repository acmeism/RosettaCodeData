Provide an algorithm as per the [[Calendar]] task, except the entire code for the algorithm must be presented entirely without lowercase. Also - as per many 1969 era [[wp:line printer#Paper (forms) handling|line printer]]s - format the calendar to nicely fill a page that is 132 characters wide.

(Hint: manually convert the code from the [[Calendar]] task to all UPPERCASE)

This task also is inspired by [http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/realmen.html Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL] by Ed Post, Datamation, volume 29 number 7, July 1983.
 THE REAL PROGRAMMER'S NATURAL HABITAT
 "Taped to the wall is a line-printer Snoopy calender for the year 1969."

Moreover this task is further inspired by the ''long lost'' corollary article titled:
 "Real programmers think in UPPERCASE"!

Note: Whereas today we ''only'' need to worry about [[wp:ASCII|ASCII]], [[wp:UTF-8|UTF-8]], [[wp:UTF-16/UCS-2|UTF-16]], [[wp:UTF-32/UCS-4|UTF-32]], [[wp:UTF-7|UTF-7]] and [[wp:UTF-EBCDIC|UTF-EBCDIC]] encodings, in the 1960s having code in UPPERCASE was often mandatory as characters were often stuffed into [[wp:36-bit|36-bit]] words as 6 lots of [[wp:6-bit|6-bit]] characters. More extreme words sizes include [[wp:60-bit|60-bit]] words of the [[wp:CDC 6000 series|CDC 6000 series]] computers.   The Soviets even had a national character set that was inclusive of all
[[wp:GOST_10859#4-bit code: Binary coded decimal|4-bit]],
[[wp:GOST_10859#5-bit code: with BCD & mathematical operators|5-bit]],
[[wp:GOST_10859#6-bit code: with only Cyrillic upper case letters|6-bit]] &
[[wp:GOST_10859#7-bit code: Cyrillic & Latin upper case letters|7-bit]] depending on how the file was opened... '''And''' one rogue Soviet university went further and built a [http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/setun.htm 1.5-bit] based computer.

Of course... as us [[wp:Baby-Boom Generation|Boomers]] have turned into [[wp:Geezer|Geezer]]s we have become [[wp:All_caps#Computing|HARD OF HEARING]], and suffer from chronic [[wp:Presbyopia|Presbyopia]], hence programming in UPPERCASE is less to do with computer architecture and more to do with practically. :-)

For economy of size, do not actually include Snoopy generation in either the code or the output, instead just output a place-holder.

FYI: a nice ASCII art file of Snoopy can be found at [http://www.textfiles.com/artscene/asciiart/cursepic.art textfiles.com].  Save with a .txt extension.
