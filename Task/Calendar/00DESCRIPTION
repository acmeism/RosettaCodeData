Create a routine that will generate a text calendar for any year.
Test the calendar by generating a calendar for the year 1969, on a device of the time.
Choose one of the following devices:

* A line printer with a width of 132 characters.
* An [[wp:IBM_3270#Displays|IBM 3278 model 4 terminal]] (80×43 display with accented characters). Target formatting the months of the year to fit nicely across the 80 character width screen. Restrict number of lines in test output to 43.

(Ideally, the program will generate well-formatted calendars for any page width from 20 characters up.)

Kudos (κῦδος) for routines that also transition from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar Julian] to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar Gregorian calendar].

This task is inspired by [http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/realmen.html Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL] by Ed Post, Datamation, volume 29 number 7, July 1983.
 THE REAL PROGRAMMER'S NATURAL HABITAT
 "Taped to the wall is a line-printer Snoopy calender for the year 1969."
For further Kudos see task [[Calendar - for "real" programmers|CALENDAR]], where all code is to be in UPPERCASE.

For economy of size, do not actually include Snoopy generation in either the code or the output, instead just output a place-holder.

For other calendar-related tasks, see [[Five weekends]].
