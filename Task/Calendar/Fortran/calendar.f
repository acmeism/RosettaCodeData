Code checking reveals that the Compaq compiler generates a copy of the string and then finds the length of that when using the latter-day intrinsic LEN_TRIM. Madness!

Curse the morons who think it good that the compiler MIGHT evaluate logical expressions fully.
Crude GO TO rather than a DO-loop, because compilers use a loop counter as well as updating the index variable.
Comparison runs of GNASH showed a saving of ~3% in its mass-data reading through the avoidance of DO in LSTNB alone.
Crappy code for character comparison of varying lengths is avoided by using ICHAR which is for single characters only.
Checking the indexing of CHARACTER variables for bounds evoked astounding stupidities, such as calculating the length of TEXT(L:L) by subtracting L from L!

       INTEGER*4 FUNCTION DAYNUM(YY,M,D)	!Computes (JDayN - JDayShift), not JDayN.
C   Conversion from a Gregorian calendar date to a Julian day number, JDayN.
C   Valid for any Gregorian calendar date producing a Julian day number
C greater than zero, though remember that the Gregorian calendar
C was not used before y1582m10d15 and often, not after that either.
C thus in England (et al) when Wednesday 2'nd September 1752 (Julian style)
C was followed by Thursday the 14'th, occasioning the Eleven Day riots
C because creditors demanded a full month's payment instead of 19/30'ths.
C   The zero of the Julian day number corresponds to the first of January
C 4713BC on the *Julian* calendar's naming scheme, as extended backwards
C with current usage into epochs when it did not exist: the proleptic Julian calendar.
c This function employs the naming scheme of the *Gregorian* calendar,
c and if extended backwards into epochs when it did not exist (thus the
c proleptic Gregorian calendar) it would compute a zero for y-4713m11d24 *if*
c it is supposed there was a year zero between 1BC and 1AD (as is convenient
c for modern mathematics and astronomers and their simple calculations), *but*
c 1BC immediately preceeds 1AD without any year zero in between (and is a leap year)
c thus the adjustment below so that the date is y-4714m11d24 or 4714BCm11d24,
c not that this name was in use at the time...
c   Although the Julian calendar (introduced by himself in what we would call 45BC,
c which was what the Romans occasionally called 709AUC) was provoked by the
c "years of confusion" resulting from arbitrary application of the rules
c for the existing Roman calendar, other confusions remain unresolved,
c so precise dating remains uncertain despite apparently precise specifications
c (and much later, Dennis the Short chose wrongly for the birth of Christ)
c and the Roman practice of inclusive reckoning meant that every four years
c was interpreted as every third (by our exclusive reckoning) so that the
c leap years were not as we now interpret them. This was resolved by Augustus
c but exactly when (and what date name is assigned) and whose writings used
c which system at the time of writing is a matter of more confusion,
c and this has continued for centuries.
C   Accordingly, although an algorithm may give a regular sequence of date names,
c that does not mean that those date names were used at the time even if the
c calendar existed then, because the interpretation of the algorithm varied.
c This in turn means that a date given as being on the Julian calendar
c prior to about 10AD is not as definite as it may appear and its alignment
c with the astronomical day number is uncertain even though the calculation
c is quite definite.
c
C   Computationally, year 1 is preceded by year 0, in a smooth progression.
C But there was never a year zero despite what astronomers like to say,
C so the formula's year 0 corresponds to 1BC, year -1 to 2BC, and so on back.
C Thus y-4713 in this counting would be 4714BC on the Gregorian calendar,
C were it to have existed then which it didn't.
C   To conform to the civil usage, the incoming YY, presumed a proper BC (negative)
C and AD (positive) year is converted into the computational counting sequence, Y,
C and used in the formula. If a YY = 0 is (improperly) offered, it will manifest
C as 1AD. Thus YY = -4714 will lead to calculations with Y = -4713.
C Thus, 1BC is a leap year on the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
C   For their convenience, astronomers decreed that a day starts at noon, so that
C in Europe, observations through the night all have the same day number.
C The current Western civil calendar however has the day starting just after midnight
C and that day's number lasts until the following midnight.
C
C   There is no constraint on the values of D, which is just added as it stands.
C This means that if D = 0, the daynumber will be that of the last day of the
C previous month. Likewise, M = 0 or M = 13 will wrap around so that Y,M + 1,0
C will give the last day of month M (whatever its length) as one day before
C the first day of the next month.
C
C   Example: Y = 1970, M = 1, D = 1;  JDAYN = 2440588, a Thursday but MOD(2440588,7) = 3.
C   and with the adjustment JDAYSHIFT, DAYNUM = 25568; mod 7 = 4 and DAYNAME(4) = "Thursday".
C   The Julian Day number 2440588.0 is for NOON that Thursday, 2440588.5 is twelve hours later.
C   And Julian Day number 2440587.625 is for three a.m. Thursday.
C
C   DAYNUM and MUNYAD are the infamous routines of H. F. Fliegel and T.C. van Flandern,
C   presented in Communications of the ACM, Vol. 11, No. 10 (October, 1968).
Carefully typed in again by R.N.McLean (whom God preserve) December XXMMIIX.

Caution: integer division in Fortran does not produce fractional results.
