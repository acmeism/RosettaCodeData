Show how to call a function in a shared library (without dynamically linking to it at compile-time). In particular, show how to call the shared library function if the library is available, otherwise use an internal equivalent function.

This is a special case of [[Call foreign language function|calling a foreign language function]] where the focus is close to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface ABI] level and not at the normal API level.
