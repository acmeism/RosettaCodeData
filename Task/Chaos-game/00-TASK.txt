The [[wp:Chaos_game|Chaos Game]] is a method of generating the attractor of an iterated function system (IFS). 

One of the best-known and simplest examples creates a fractal, using a polygon and an initial point selected at random.


;Task
Play the Chaos Game using the corners of an equilateral triangle as the reference points. &nbsp; Add a starting point at random (preferably inside the triangle). &nbsp; Then add the next point halfway between the starting point and one of the reference points. &nbsp; This reference point is chosen at random.

After a sufficient number of iterations, the image of a Sierpinski Triangle should emerge.
