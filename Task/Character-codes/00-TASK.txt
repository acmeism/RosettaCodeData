;Task:
Given a character value in your language, print its code &nbsp; (could be ASCII code, Unicode code, or whatever your language uses). 


;Example:
The character &nbsp; 'a' &nbsp; (lowercase letter A) &nbsp; has a code of 97 in ASCII &nbsp; (as well as Unicode, as ASCII forms the beginning of Unicode). 

Conversely, given a code, print out the corresponding character.
