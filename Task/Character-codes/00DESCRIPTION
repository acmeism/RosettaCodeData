Given a character value in your language, print its code (could be ASCII code, Unicode code, or whatever your language uses). For example, the character 'a' (lowercase letter A) has a code of 97 in ASCII (as well as Unicode, as ASCII forms the beginning of Unicode). Conversely, given a code, print out the corresponding character.
