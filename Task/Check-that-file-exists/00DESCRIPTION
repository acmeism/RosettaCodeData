In this task, the job is to verify that a file called "input.txt" and the directory called "docs" exist.
This should be done twice: once for the current working directory and once for a file and a directory in the filesystem root.

Optional criteria (May 2015): verify it works with 0-length files; and with an unusual filename: `Abdu'l-Bah√°.txt
