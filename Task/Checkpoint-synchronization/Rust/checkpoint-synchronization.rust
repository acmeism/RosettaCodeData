//! We implement this task using Rust's Barriers.  Barriers are simply thread synchronization
//! points--if a task waits at a barrier, it will not continue until the number of tasks for which
//! the variable was initialized are also waiting at the barrier, at which point all of them will
//! stop waiting.  This can be used to allow threads to do asynchronous work and guarantee
//! properties at checkpoints.
