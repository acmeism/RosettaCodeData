[[File:2 circles through 2 points.jpg|500px||right|2 circles with a given radius through 2 points in 2D space.]]

Given two points on a plane and a radius, usually two circles of given radius can be drawn through the points.
;Exceptions:
# r==0.0 should be treated as never describing circles (except in the case where the points are coincident).
# If the points are coincident then an infinite number of circles with the point on their circumference can be drawn, unless r==0.0 as well which then collapses the circles to a point.
# If the points form a diameter then return two identical circles ''or'' return a single circle, according to which is the most natural mechanism for the implementation language.
# If the points are too far apart then no circles can be drawn.


;Task detail:
* Write a function/subroutine/method/... that takes two points and a radius and returns the two circles through those points, ''or some indication of special cases where two, possibly equal, circles cannot be returned''.
* Show here the output for the following inputs:
<pre>
      p1                p2           r
0.1234, 0.9876    0.8765, 0.2345    2.0
0.0000, 2.0000    0.0000, 0.0000    1.0
0.1234, 0.9876    0.1234, 0.9876    2.0
0.1234, 0.9876    0.8765, 0.2345    0.5
0.1234, 0.9876    0.1234, 0.9876    0.0
</pre>
