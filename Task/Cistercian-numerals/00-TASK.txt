Cistercian numerals were used across Europe by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians Cistercian] monks during the Late Medieval Period as an alternative to Roman numerals. They were used to represent base 10 integers from '''0''' to '''9999'''.

;How they work
All Cistercian numerals begin with a vertical line segment, which by itself represents the number '''0'''. Then, glyphs representing the digits '''1''' through '''9''' are optionally added to the four quadrants surrounding the vertical line segment. These glyphs are drawn with vertical and horizontal symmetry about the initial line segment. Each quadrant corresponds to a digit place in the number:

:* The '''upper-right''' quadrant represents the '''ones''' place.
:* The '''upper-left''' quadrant represents the '''tens''' place.
:* The '''lower-right''' quadrant represents the '''hundreds''' place.
:* The '''lower-left''' quadrant represents the '''thousands''' place.

;Task

:* Write a function/procedure/routine to display any given Cistercian numeral. This could be done by drawing to the display, creating an image, or even as text (as long as it is a reasonable facsimile).

:* Use the routine to show the following Cistercian numerals:

::* 0
::* 1
::* 20
::* 300
::* 4000
::* 5555
::* 6789
::* And a number of your choice!

Due to the inability to upload images to Rosetta Code as of this task's creation, showing output here on this page is not required. However, it is welcomed â€” especially for text output.
