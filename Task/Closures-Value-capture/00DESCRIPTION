;Task:
Create a list of ten functions, in the simplest manner possible &nbsp; (anonymous functions are encouraged), &nbsp; such that the function at index&nbsp;&nbsp;<big> ''<b> i </b>'' </big> &nbsp; (you may choose to start &nbsp; <big> ''<b> i </b>'' </big> &nbsp; from either &nbsp; <big> '''0''' </big> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <big> '''1'''), </big>  &nbsp; when run, should return the square of the index, &nbsp; that is, &nbsp; <big> ''<b> i </b>'' <sup>2</sup>.</big>

Display the result of running any but the last function, to demonstrate that the function indeed remembers its value.


;Goal:
Demonstrate how to create a series of independent closures based on the same template but maintain separate copies of the variable closed over.

In imperative languages, one would generally use a loop with a mutable counter variable.

For each function to maintain the correct number, it has to capture the ''value'' of the variable at the time it was created, rather than just a reference to the variable, which would have a different value by the time the function was run.
