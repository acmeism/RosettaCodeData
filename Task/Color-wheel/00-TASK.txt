;Task:
Write a function to draw a [[wp:HSL_and_HSV|HSV]] color wheel completely with code. 

This is strictly for learning purposes only. It's highly recommended that you use an image in an actual application to actually draw the color wheel &nbsp; (as procedurally drawing is super slow). This does help you understand how color wheels work and this can easily be used to determine a color value based on a position within a circle.
