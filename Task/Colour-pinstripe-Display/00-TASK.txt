The task is to create 1 pixel wide coloured vertical pinstripes with a sufficient number of pinstripes to span the entire width of the graphics display. 


The pinstripes should either follow the system palette sequence, &nbsp; or a sequence that includes: 
<br>black, &nbsp; red, &nbsp; green, &nbsp; blue, &nbsp; magenta, &nbsp; cyan, &nbsp; yellow, &nbsp; and &nbsp; white:
::* &nbsp; after filling the top quarter, switch to a wider 2 pixel wide vertical pinstripe pattern,
::* &nbsp; halfway down the display, switch to 3 pixel wide vertical pinstripe,
::* &nbsp; finally to a 4 pixels wide vertical pinstripe for the last quarter of the display.
