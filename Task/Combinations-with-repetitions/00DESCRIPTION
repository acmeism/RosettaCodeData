The set of combinations with repetitions is computed from a set, <math>S</math> (of cardinality <math>n</math>), and a size of resulting selection, <math>k</math>, by reporting the sets of cardinality <math>k</math> where each member of those sets is chosen from <math>S</math>.
In the real world, it is about choosing sets where there is a “large” supply of each type of element and where the order of choice does not matter.
For example:
:Q: How many ways can a person choose two doughnuts from a store selling three types of doughnut: iced, jam, and plain? (i.e., <math>S</math> is <math>\{\mathrm{iced}, \mathrm{jam}, \mathrm{plain}\}</math>, <math>|S| = 3</math>, and <math>k = 2</math>.)

:A: 6: {iced, iced}; {iced, jam}; {iced, plain}; {jam, jam}; {jam, plain}; {plain, plain}.

<small>Note that both the order of items within a pair, and the order of the pairs given in the answer is not significant; the pairs represent multisets.</small>
<br><small>Also note that ''doughnut'' can also be spelled ''donut''.</small>

'''Task description'''
* Write a function/program/routine/.. to generate all the combinations with repetitions of <math>n</math> types of things taken <math>k</math> at a time and use it to ''show'' an answer to the doughnut example above.
* For extra credit, use the function to compute and show ''just the number of ways'' of choosing three doughnuts from a choice of ten types of doughnut. Do not show the individual choices for this part.
