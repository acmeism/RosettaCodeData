Given non-negative integers <tt>m</tt> and <tt>n</tt>, generate all size <tt>m</tt> [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Combination.html combinations] of the integers from 0 to <tt>n-1</tt> in sorted order (each combination is sorted and the entire table is sorted).

For example, <tt>3 comb 5</tt> is
 0 1 2
 0 1 3
 0 1 4
 0 2 3
 0 2 4
 0 3 4
 1 2 3
 1 2 4
 1 3 4
 2 3 4

If it is more "natural" in your language to start counting from <tt>1</tt> instead of <tt>0</tt> the combinations can be of the integers from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>n</tt>.
