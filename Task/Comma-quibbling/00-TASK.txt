Comma quibbling is a task originally set by Eric Lippert in his [https://web.archive.org/web/20190202111812/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2009/04/15/comma-quibbling/ blog].


;Task:

Write a function to generate a string output which is the concatenation of input words from a list/sequence where:
# An input of no words produces the output string of just the two brace characters "{}".
# An input of just one word, e.g. ["ABC"], produces the output string of the word inside the two braces, e.g. "{ABC}".
# An input of two words, e.g. ["ABC", "DEF"], produces the output string of the two words inside the two braces with the words separated by the string " and ", e.g. "{ABC and DEF}".
# An input of three or more words, e.g. ["ABC", "DEF", "G", "H"], produces the output string of all but the last word separated by ", " with the last word separated by " and " and all within braces; e.g. "{ABC, DEF, G and H}".

<br>
Test your function with the following series of inputs showing your output here on this page:
* [] # (No input words).
* ["ABC"]
* ["ABC", "DEF"]
* ["ABC", "DEF", "G", "H"]

<br>
Note: Assume words are non-empty strings of uppercase characters for this task.
