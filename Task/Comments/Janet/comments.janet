(according to Gemini AI):

The Janet programming language uses the # character for comments.

Single-line comments: Everything from # to the end of the line is treated as a comment.

Janet does not have built-in multi-line comments in the same way some other languages do (like {- ... -} in Idris2 or /* ... */ in C-like languages). However, because Janet is expression-oriented, you can often use multi-line strings as a form of "comment" if you put them in a context where their value isn't used.
