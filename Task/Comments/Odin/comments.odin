(According to Gemini AI):

The Odin programming language supports two types of comment characters:

Single-line comments: Begin with //.

Code snippet
// This is a single-line comment
my_variable: int // A comment for documentation
Multi-line comments: Begin with /* and end with */. Multi-line comments can also be nested.

Code snippet
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
/* NOTE: comments can be nested! */
You can have any text or code here and have it be commented.
*/
