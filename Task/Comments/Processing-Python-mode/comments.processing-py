# a single-line comment

"""
Not strictly a comment, bare multi-line strings are used
in Python as multi-line comments. They are also used as
documentation strings or 'docstrings' when placed as the
first element inside function or class definitions.

# comment out a code line
# println("foo")

# comment at the end of a line
println("foo bar") # "baz"

# there is no way to make an inline comment
