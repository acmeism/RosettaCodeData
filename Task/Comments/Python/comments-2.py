"""Un-assigned strings in triple-quotes might be used
   as multi-line comments
"""

'''
   "triple quoted strings" can be delimited by either 'single' or "double" quote marks; and they can contain mixtures
   of other quote marks without any need to \escape\ them using any special characters.  They also may span multiple
   lines without special escape characters.
