Rockstar is cool.
(Rockstars don't like comments, but if you really really want to, you write them in parentheses and they are believed to be multiline. In fact, parentheses are just the comment symbols, so you can't even use parentheses in math, so if you want the addition to happen before the multiplication, do the addition and assign it to a variable. And by the way, the Rockstar is cool line assigned the number 4 to the variable Rockstar, because cool is four letters and all that. And this comment has gone on way too long for a language with a developer community that hates comments.)
Shout Rockstar.
(Might as well put that number 4 on the screen.)
