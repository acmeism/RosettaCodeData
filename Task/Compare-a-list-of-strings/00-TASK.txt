;Task:
Given a &nbsp; [[wp:List_(abstract_data_type)|list]] &nbsp; of arbitrarily many strings, show how to:

* &nbsp; test if they are all lexically '''equal'''
* &nbsp; test if every string is lexically '''less than''' the one after it  ''(i.e. whether the list is in strict ascending order)''

<br>
Each of those two tests should result in a single true or false value, which could be used as the condition of an &nbsp; <code> if </code> &nbsp; statement or similar. 

If the input list has less than two elements, the tests should always return true.

There is ''no'' need to provide a complete program and output.
 
Assume that the strings are already stored in an array/list/sequence/tuple variable (whatever is most idiomatic) with the name &nbsp; <code>strings</code>, &nbsp; and just show the expressions for performing those two tests on it (plus of course any includes and custom functions etc. that it needs), &nbsp; with as little distractions as possible.

Try to write your solution in a way that does not modify the original list, &nbsp; but if it does then please add a note to make that clear to readers.

<i>If you need further guidance/clarification, &nbsp; see [[#Perl]] and [[#Python]] for solutions that use implicit short-circuiting loops, &nbsp; and [[#Raku]] for a solution that gets away with simply using a built-in language feature. </i>
