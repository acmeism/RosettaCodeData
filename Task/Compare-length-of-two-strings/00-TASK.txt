;Task:
Given two strings of different length, determine which string is longer or shorter. Print both strings and their length, one on each line. Print the longer one first.

Measure the length of your string in terms of bytes or characters, as appropriate for your language. If your language doesn't have an operator for measuring the length of a string, note it.

;Extra credit:
Given more than two strings:
<br>list = ["abcd","123456789","abcdef","1234567"]
<br>Show the strings in descending length order.
