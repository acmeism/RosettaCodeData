;Task:
Using either native language concurrency syntax or freely available libraries, write a program to display the strings "Enjoy" "Rosetta" "Code", one string per line, in random order. 

Concurrency syntax must use [[thread|threads]], tasks, co-routines, or whatever concurrency is called in your language.
