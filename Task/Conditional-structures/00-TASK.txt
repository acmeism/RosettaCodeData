{{Control Structures}} 
[[Category:Simple]]

;Task:
List the ''conditional structures'' offered by a programming language. See [[wp:Conditional_(computer_programming)|Wikipedia: conditionals]] for descriptions.

Common conditional structures include '''if-then-else''' and '''switch'''.

Less common are '''arithmetic if''', '''ternary operator''' and '''Hash-based conditionals'''.

'''''Arithmetic if''' allows tight control over computed gotos, which optimizers have a hard time to figure out.''
