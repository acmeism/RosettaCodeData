		BNE 		;Branch on Not Equal - branch when the zero flag is set
		BEQ 		;Branch on EQual - branch when the zero flag is set.
				;The zero flag is set when the result of an operation is zero

		BMI 		;Branch on MInus
		BPL 		;Branch on PLus - branch when the sign flag is cleared/set.
				;The sign flag is set when the result of an instruction is a negative number
				;and cleared when the result is a positive number

		BVS 		;Branch on oVerflow Set
		BVC 		;Branch on oVerflow Cleared - branch when the overflow flag is cleared/set.
				;The overflow flag is set when the result of an addition/subtraction would
				;result in a number larger than 127 or smaller than -128

		BCS		;Branch on Carry Set
		BCC		;Branch on Carry Clear - branch when the carry flag is cleared/set.
				;The carry flag is set when an addition produced a carry and when
				;a subtraction produced a borrow and cleared if an addition/subtraction
				;does not produce a carry/borrow.  The carry flag also holds bits
				;after shifts and rotates.
