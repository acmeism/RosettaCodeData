;Task:
<br><br>
Find and display here on this page, the longest sequence of consecutive prime numbers where the differences between the primes are strictly ascending.<br><br>
Do the same for sequences of primes where the differences are strictly descending.
<br><br>
In both cases, show the sequence for primes &nbsp; <big>&lt;</big> &nbsp; 1,000,000.
<br><br>
If there are multiple sequences of the same length, only the first need be shown.
