use std::iter;

// Calculating a continued fraction is quite easy with iterators, however
// writing a proper iterator adapter is less so. We settle for a macro which
// for most purposes works well enough.
//
// One limitation with this iterator based approach is that we cannot reverse
// input iterators since they are not usually DoubleEnded. To circumvent this
// we can collect the elements and then reverse them, however this isn't ideal
// as we now have to store elements equal to the number of iterations.
//
// Another is that iterators cannot be resused once consumed, so it is often
// required to make many clones of iterators.
