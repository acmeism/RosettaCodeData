Find the points which form a [[wp:Convex hull|convex hull]] from a set of arbitrary two dimensional points.

For example, given the points (16,3),  (12,17), (0,6),   (-4,-6), (16,6),  (16,-7), (16,-3), (17,-4), (5,19),  (19,-8), (3,16),  (12,13), (3,-4),  (17,5),  (-3,15), (-3,-9), (0,11),  (-9,-3), (-4,-2) and (12,10) the convex hull would be (-9,-3), (-3,-9), (19,-8), (17,5), (12,17), (5,19) and (-3,15).
