The '''Game of Life''' is a &nbsp; [[wp:cellular automaton|cellular automaton]] &nbsp; devised by the British mathematician &nbsp; [[wp:John Horton Conway|John Horton Conway]] &nbsp; in 1970. &nbsp; It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

Conway's game of life is described &nbsp; [[wp:Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|here]]:
    
A cell &nbsp; '''C''' &nbsp; is represented by a &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; when alive, &nbsp; or &nbsp; '''0''' &nbsp; when dead, &nbsp; in an &nbsp; m-by-m &nbsp; (or <big>m</big>&times;<big>m</big>) &nbsp; square array of cells. 

We calculate &nbsp; '''N''' &nbsp; - the sum of live cells in C's &nbsp; [[wp:Moore neighborhood|eight-location neighbourhood]], &nbsp; then cell &nbsp; C &nbsp; is alive or dead in the next generation based on the following table:
    '''C   N                 new C'''
    1   0,1             ->  0  # Lonely
    1   4,5,6,7,8       ->  0  # Overcrowded
    1   2,3             ->  1  # Lives
    0   3               ->  1  # It takes three to give birth!
    0   0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8 ->  0  # Barren

Assume cells beyond the boundary are always dead.

The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players. &nbsp; One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.


;Task:
Although you should test your implementation on more complex examples such as the &nbsp; [[wp:Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns|glider]] &nbsp; in a larger universe, &nbsp; show the action of the blinker &nbsp; (three adjoining cells in a row all alive), &nbsp; over three generations, in a 3 by 3 grid.
