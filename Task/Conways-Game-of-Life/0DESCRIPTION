The '''Game of Life''' is a [[wp:cellular automaton|cellular automaton]] devised by the British mathematician [[wp:John Horton Conway|John Horton Conway]] in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

Conway's game of life is described [[wp:Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|here]]:

A cell '''C''' is represented by a 1 when alive or 0 when dead, in an m-by-m square array of cells. We calculate '''N''' - the sum of live cells in C's [[wp:Moore neighborhood|eight-location neighbourhood]], then cell C is alive or dead in the next generation based on the following table:
    '''C   N                 new C'''
    1   0,1             ->  0  # Lonely
    1   4,5,6,7,8       ->  0  # Overcrowded
    1   2,3             ->  1  # Lives
    0   3               ->  1  # It takes three to give birth!
    0   0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8 ->  0  # Barren

Assume cells beyond the boundary are always dead.

The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

Although you should test your implementation on more complex examples such as the [[wp:Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns|glider]] in a larger universe, show the action of the blinker (three adjoining cells in a row all alive), over three generations, in a 3 by 3 grid.
