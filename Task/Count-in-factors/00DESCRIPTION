Write a program which counts up from 1, displaying each number as the multiplication of its prime factors. For the purpose of this task, <math>1</math> may be shown as itself.

For example, <math>2</math> is prime, so it would be shown as itself. <math>6</math> is not prime; it would be shown as <math>2\times3</math>. Likewise, 2144 is not prime; it would be shown as <math>2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times67</math>.

c.f. [[Prime decomposition]]
