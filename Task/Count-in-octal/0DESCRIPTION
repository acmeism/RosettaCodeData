The task is to produce a sequential count in octal, starting at zero, and using an increment of a one for each consecutive number. Each number should appear on a single line, and the program should count until terminated, or until the maximum value of the numeric type in use is reached.

* [[Integer sequence]] is a similar task without the use of octal numbers.
