;Task:
Create a function, &nbsp; or show a built-in function, &nbsp; to count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring inside a string.

The function should take two arguments: 
:::* &nbsp; the first argument being the string to search, &nbsp; and 
:::* &nbsp; the second a substring to be searched for. 


It should return an integer count.
<syntaxhighlight lang="pseudocode">print countSubstring("the three truths","th")
3

// do not count substrings that overlap with previously-counted substrings:
print countSubstring("ababababab","abab")
2</syntaxhighlight>

The matching should yield the highest number of non-overlapping matches. 

In general, this essentially means matching from left-to-right or right-to-left &nbsp; (see proof on talk page).
