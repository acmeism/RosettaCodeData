The task is to either create a function, or show a built-in function, to count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring inside a string. The function should take two arguments: the first argument being the string to search and the second a substring to be search for. It should return an integer count.

<lang pseudocode>print countSubstring("the three truths","th")
3

// do not count substrings that overlap with previously-counted substrings:
print countSubstring("ababababab","abab")
2</lang>

The matching should yield the highest number of non-overlapping matches. In general, this essentially means matching from left-to-right or right-to-left (see proof on talk page).
