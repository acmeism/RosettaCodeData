Create an HTML table.
* The table body should have at least three rows of three columns.
* Each of these three columns should be labelled "X", "Y", and "Z".
* An extra column should be added at either the extreme left or the extreme right of the table that has no heading, but is filled with sequential row numbers.
* The rows of the "X", "Y", and "Z" columns should be filled with random or sequential integers having 4 digits or less.
* The numbers should be aligned in the same fashion for all columns.
