Curse the morons who think it good that the compiler MIGHT evaluate logical expressions fully.
Crude GO TO rather than a DO-loop, because compilers use a loop counter as well as updating the index variable.
Comparison runs of GNASH showed a saving of ~3% in its mass-data reading through the avoidance of DO in LSTNB alone.
Crappy code for character comparison of varying lengths is avoided by using ICHAR which is for single characters only.
Checking the indexing of CHARACTER variables for bounds evoked astounding stupidities, such as calculating the length of TEXT(L:L) by subtracting L from L!

Compaq's compiler was taken over by unintel; http://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/hpc/compilerpro/en-us/fortran/lin/compiler_f/bldaps_for/common/bldaps_rterrs.htm
contains a schedule of error numbers that matched those I'd found for Compaq, and so some assumptions are added.
Copying all (hundreds!) is excessive; these seem possible for the usage so far made of error diversion.
Compaq's compiler interface ("visual" blah) has a help offering, which can provide error code information.
Compaq messages also appear in http://cens.ioc.ee/local/man/CompaqCompilers/cf/dfuum028.htm#tab_runtime_errors

C   Once upon a time, there was just confusion between ASCII and EBCDIC character codes and glyphs,
c after many variant collections caused annoyance. Now I see that modern computing has introduced
c many new variations, so that one text editor may display glyphs differing from those displayed
c by another editor and also different from those displayed when a programme writes to the screen
c in "teletype" mode, which is to say, employing the character/glyph combination of the moment.
c And in particular, decimal points and degree symbols differ and annoyance has grown.
c   So, on re-arranging SAY to not send output to multiple distinations depending on the value of OUT,
c except for the special output to MSG that is echoed to TRAIL, it became less messy to make an assault
c on the text that goes to MSG, but after it was sent to TRAIL. I would have preferred to fiddle the
c "code page" for text output that determines what glyph to show for which code, but not only
c is it unclear how to do this, even if facilities were available, I suspect that the screen display
c software only loads the mysterious code page during startup.
c   This fiddling means that any write to MSG should be done last, and writes of text literals
c should not include characters that will be fiddled, as text literals may be protected against change.
