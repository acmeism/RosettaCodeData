{{basic data operation}}

In systems programing it is sometimes required to place language objects at specific memory locations, like I/O registers, hardware interrupt vectors etc.


;Task:
Show how language objects can be allocated at a specific machine addresses.

Since most [[OS]]es prohibit access to the physical memory if it is not mapped by the application, as an example, rather than a physical address, take the address of some existing object (using suitable [[Address Operations|address operations]] if necessary). 


For example: 
::* &nbsp; create an integer object
::* &nbsp; print the machine address of the object
::* &nbsp; take the address of the object and create another integer object at this address
::* &nbsp; print the value of this object to verify that it is same as one of the origin
::* &nbsp; change the value of the origin and verify it again
