The name &nbsp; '''cuban''' &nbsp; has nothing to do with &nbsp; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba Cuba &nbsp;(the country)], &nbsp; but has to do with the
fact that cubes &nbsp; (3<sup>rd</sup> powers) &nbsp; play a role in its definition.


;Some definitions of cuban primes:
::* &nbsp; primes which are the difference of two consecutive cubes.
::* &nbsp; primes of the form: &nbsp; (n+1)<sup>3</sup> -     n<sup>3</sup>.
::* &nbsp; primes of the form: &nbsp;     n<sup>3</sup> - (n-1)<sup>3</sup>.
::* &nbsp; primes &nbsp; ''p'' &nbsp; such that &nbsp; n<sup>2</sup>(''p''+n) &nbsp; is a cube for some &nbsp; n>0.
::* &nbsp; primes &nbsp; ''p'' &nbsp; such that &nbsp; 4''p'' = 1 + 3n<sup>2</sup>.


Cuban primes were named in 1923 by Allan Joseph Champneys Cunningham.
