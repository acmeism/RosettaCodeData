A given rectangle is made from ''m'' × ''n'' squares. If ''m'' and ''n'' are not both odd, then it is possible to cut a path through the rectangle along the square edges such that the rectangle splits into two connected pieces with the same shape (after rotating one of the pieces by 180°). All such paths for 2 × 2 and 4 × 3 rectangles are shown below.

Write a program that calculates the number of different ways to cut an ''m'' × ''n'' rectangle.  Optionally, show each of the cuts.
