The nth Cyclotomic polynomial, for any positive integer n, is the unique irreducible polynomial of largest degree with integer coefficients that is a divisor of x^n − 1, and is not a divisor of x^k − 1 for any k < n.


;Task:
*   Find and print the first 30 cyclotomic polynomials.
*   Find and print the order of the first 10 cyclotomic polynomials that have n or -n as a coefficient.
