;Task:
Demonstrate how to copy data structures containing complex heterogeneous and cyclic semantics.

This is often referred to as [[wp:Deep_copy#Deep_copy|deep copying]], and is normally required where structures are mutable and to ensure that independent copies can be manipulated without side-effects.

If this facility is not built into the language, it is permissible to use functions from a common library, or a coded procedure.


The task should show:

* Relevant semantics of structures, such as their [[wp:Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous or heterogeneous]] properties, or containment of (self- or mutual-reference) cycles.

* Any limitations of the method.

* That the structure and its copy are different.

* Suitable links to external documentation for common libraries.
