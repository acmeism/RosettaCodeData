There is a highly organized city that has decided to assign a number to each of their departments:
::* &nbsp; police department
::* &nbsp; sanitation department
::* &nbsp; fire department 


Each department can have a number between &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''7''' &nbsp; (inclusive).

The three department numbers are to be unique (different from each other) and must add up to &nbsp; '''12'''.

The Chief of the Police doesn't like odd numbers and wants to have an even number for his department.


;Task:
Write a computer program which outputs <u>all</u> valid combinations.


Possible output &nbsp; (for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> solutions):
  
  --police--  --sanitation--  --fire-- 
      2             3            7 
      6             5            1
