    'Problem 2. Find the path of minimum total length between two given nodes
    'P and Q.
    'We use the fact that, if R is a node on the minimal path from P to Q, knowledge
    'of the latter implies the knowledge of the minimal path from P to A. In the
    'solution presented, the minimal paths from P to the other nodes are constructed
    'in order of increasing length until Q is reached.
    'In the course of the solution the nodes are subdivided into three sets:
    'A. the nodes for which the path of minimum length from P is known; nodes
    'will be added to this set in order of increasing minimum path length from node P;
    '[comments in square brackets are not by Dijkstra]

    'set A but do not yet belong to A themselves;
    Dim b As New Collection '[of nodes (vertices)]
    'C. the remaining nodes.
    Dim c As New Collection '[of nodes (vertices)]
    'The Branches are also subdivided into three sets:
    'I the Branches occurring in the minimal paths from node P to the nodes
    'in set A;
    Dim I As New Collection '[of Branches (edges)]
    'II the Branches from which the next branch to be placed in set I will be
    'selected; one and only one branch of this set will lead to each node in set B;

        'path that uses the corresponding branch in set II. If this is not so, branch r is
        'rejected; if, however, use of branch r results in a shorter connexion between P
        'and R than hitherto obtained, it replaces the corresponding branch in set II
