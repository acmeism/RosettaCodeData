The graphic representation of outlines is a staple of mind-mapping and the planning of papers, reports, and speeches.

;Task:
Given a outline with at least 3 levels of indentation, for example:

<pre>Display an outline as a nested table.
    Parse the outline to a tree,
        measuring the indent of each line,
        translating the indentation to a nested structure,
        and padding the tree to even depth.
    count the leaves descending from each node,
        defining the width of a leaf as 1,
        and the width of a parent node as a sum.
            (The sum of the widths of its children)
    and write out a table with 'colspan' values
        either as a wiki table,
        or as HTML.</pre>

write a program in your language which translates your outline into a nested table, with WikiTable or HTML [[wp:Wikipedia:Advanced_table_formatting|colspan]] values attached (where needed) to parent nodes in the nested table.

The WikiTable at the top of this page was generated from the indented outline shown above, producing the following markup string:

<pre>{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
| style="background: #ffffe6; " colspan=7 | Display an outline as a nested table.
|-
| style="background: #ffebd2; " colspan=3 | Parse the outline to a tree,
| style="background: #f0fff0; " colspan=2 | count the leaves descending from each node,
| style="background: #e6ffff; " colspan=2 | and write out a table with 'colspan' values
|-
| style="background: #ffebd2; " | measuring the indent of each line,
| style="background: #ffebd2; " | translating the indentation to a nested structure,
| style="background: #ffebd2; " | and padding the tree to even depth.
| style="background: #f0fff0; " | defining the width of a leaf as 1,
| style="background: #f0fff0; " | and the width of a parent node as a sum.
| style="background: #e6ffff; " | either as a wiki table,
| style="background: #e6ffff; " | or as HTML.
|-
|  | 
|  | 
|  | 
|  | 
| style="background: #f0fff0; " | (The sum of the widths of its children)
|  | 
|  | 
|}</pre>

;Extra credit:
Use background color to distinguish the main stages of your outline, so that the subtree of each node at level two is consistently colored, and the edges between adjacent subtrees are immediately revealed.

;Output:
Display your nested table on this page.
