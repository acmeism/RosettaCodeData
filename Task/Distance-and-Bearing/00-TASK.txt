It is very important in aviation to have knowledge of the nearby airports at any time in flight. 
;Task:
Determine the distance and bearing from an Airplane to the 20 nearest Airports whenever requested.
Use the non-commercial data from openflights.org [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports.dat airports.dat] as reference.


A request comes from an airplane at position  ( latitude, longitude ): ( '''51.514669, 2.198581''' ).


Your report should contain the following information from table airports.dat (column shown in brackets):

Name(2), Country(4), ICAO(6), Distance and Bearing calculated from Latitude(7) and Longitude(8).  


Distance is measured in nautical miles (NM). Resolution is 0.1 NM.

Bearing is measured in degrees (°). 0° = 360° = north then clockwise 90° = east, 180° = south, 270° = west. Resolution is 1°.
