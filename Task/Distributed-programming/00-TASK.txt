Write two programs (or one program with two modes) which run on networked computers, and send some messages between them.

The protocol used may be language-specific or not, and should be '''suitable for general distributed programming'''; that is, the ''protocol'' should be generic (not designed just for the particular example application), readily capable of handling the independent communications of many different components of a single application, and the transferring of arbitrary data structures natural for the language.

This task is intended to demonstrate high-level communication facilities beyond just creating [[sockets]].
