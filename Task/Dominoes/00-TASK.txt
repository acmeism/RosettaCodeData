Take a box of dominoes give them a good shuffle and then arrange them in diverse orientations such that they form a rectangle with 7 rows of 8 columns. Make a tableau of the face values e.g.

        05132231
        05505246
        43036620
        06235126
        11300245
        21433466
        64515414

Now torment your computer by making it identify where each domino is.

Do this for the above tableau and one of your own construction.

How many ways are there to arrange dominoes in an 8x7 rectangle, first ignoring their values, then considering their values, and finally considering values but ignoring value symmetry, i.e. transposing 5 and 4.
