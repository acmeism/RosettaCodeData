;Task:
Create a function/use an in-built function, to compute the &nbsp; '''[[wp:Dot product|dot product]]''', &nbsp; also known as the &nbsp; '''scalar product''' &nbsp; of two vectors. 

If possible, make the vectors of arbitrary length.


As an example, compute the dot product of the vectors:
:::: &nbsp; <big> <code> [1, &nbsp;3, -5] </code> </big> &nbsp; &nbsp; and 
:::: &nbsp; <big> <code> [4,      -2, -1] </code> </big> 

<br>
If implementing the dot product of two vectors directly:
:::* &nbsp; each vector must be the same length
:::* &nbsp; multiply corresponding terms from each vector
:::* &nbsp; sum the products &nbsp; (to produce the answer)
