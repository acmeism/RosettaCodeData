Use the link structure defined in [[Doubly-Linked List (element)]] to define a procedure for inserting a link into a doubly-linked list. Call this procedure to insert element C into a list {A,B}, between elements A and B.

This is much like inserting into a [[Singly-Linked List (element insertion)|Singly-Linked List]], but with added assignments so that the backwards-pointing links remain correct.
