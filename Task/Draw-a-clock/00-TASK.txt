;Task:
Draw a clock.  


More specific:
# Draw a time keeping device. It can be a stopwatch, hourglass, sundial, a mouth counting "one thousand and one", anything. Only showing the seconds is required, e.g.: a watch with just a second hand will suffice. However, it must clearly change every second, and the change must cycle every so often (one minute, 30 seconds, etc.) It must be ''drawn''; printing a string of numbers to your terminal doesn't qualify. Both text-based and graphical drawing are OK.
# The clock is unlikely to be used to control space flights, so it needs not be hyper-accurate, but it should be usable, meaning if one can read the seconds off the clock, it must agree with the system clock.
# A clock is rarely (never?) a major application: don't be a CPU hog and poll the system timer every microsecond, use a proper timer/signal/event from your system or language instead. For a bad example, many OpenGL programs update the frame-buffer in a busy loop even if no redraw is needed, which is very undesirable for this task.
# A clock is rarely (never?) a major application: try to keep your code simple and to the point. Don't write something too elaborate or convoluted, instead do whatever is natural, concise and clear in your language.
