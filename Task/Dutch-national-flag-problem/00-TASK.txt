The Dutch national flag is composed of three coloured bands in the order:
::* &nbsp; red &nbsp; &nbsp; (top)
::* &nbsp; then white, &nbsp; and
::* &nbsp; lastly blue &nbsp; (at the bottom). 


The problem posed by [[wp:Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] is:
:Given a number of red, blue and white balls in random order, arrange them in the order of the colours in the Dutch national flag.
When the problem was first posed, Dijkstra then went on to successively refine a solution, minimising the number of swaps and the number of times the colour of a ball needed to determined and restricting the balls to end in an array, ...


;Task
# Generate a randomized order of balls ''ensuring that they are not in the order of the Dutch national flag''.
# Sort the balls in a way idiomatic to your language.
# Check the sorted balls ''are'' in the order of the Dutch national flag.
