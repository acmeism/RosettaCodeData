-- varName might contain a string that was entered by a user at runtime

-- A new global variable with a user-defined name can be created at runtime like this:
(the globals)[varName] = 23 -- or (the globals).setProp(varName, 23)

-- An new instance variable (object property) with a user-defined name can be created at runtime like this:
obj[varName] = 23 -- or obj.setProp(varName, 23)
