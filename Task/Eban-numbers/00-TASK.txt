;Definition:
An &nbsp; '''eban''' &nbsp; number is a number that has no letter &nbsp; <big> '''e''' </big> &nbsp; in it when the number is spelled in English.

Or more literally, &nbsp; spelled numbers that contain the letter &nbsp; '''e''' &nbsp; are banned.


The American version of spelling numbers will be used here &nbsp; (as opposed to the British).

'''2,000,000,000''' &nbsp; is two billion, &nbsp; ''not'' &nbsp; two milliard.


Only numbers less than &nbsp; '''one sextillion''' &nbsp; ('''10<sup>21</sup>''') &nbsp; will be considered in/for this task.

This will allow optimizations to be used.



;Task:
:::* &nbsp; show all eban numbers &nbsp; â‰¤ &nbsp; '''1,000''' &nbsp; (in a horizontal format),                 &nbsp; and a count
