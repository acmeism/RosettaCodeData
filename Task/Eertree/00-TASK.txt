An '''eertree''' is a data structure designed for efficient processing of certain palindrome tasks, for instance counting the number of sub-palindromes in an input string. 

The data structure has commonalities to both ''tries'' and ''suffix trees''.
&nbsp; See links below. 


;Task:
Construct an eertree for the string "eertree", then output all sub-palindromes by traversing the tree.
