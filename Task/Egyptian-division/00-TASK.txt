Egyptian division is a method of dividing integers using addition and 
doubling that is similar to the algorithm of [[Ethiopian multiplication]]

'''Algorithm:'''

Given two numbers where the '''dividend''' is to be divided by the '''divisor''':

# Start the construction of a table of two columns: '''<code>powers_of_2</code>''', and '''<code>doublings</code>'''; by a first row of a 1 (i.e. 2^0) in the first column and 1 times the divisor in the first row second column.
# Create the second row with columns of 2 (i.e 2^1), and 2 * divisor in order.
# Continue with successive iâ€™th rows of 2^i and 2^i * divisor.
# Stop adding rows, and keep only those rows, where 2^i * divisor is less than or equal to the dividend.
# We now assemble two separate sums that both start as zero, called here '''answer''' and '''accumulator'''
# Consider each row of the table, in the ''reverse'' order of its construction.
# If the current value of the accumulator added to the doublings cell would be less than or equal to the dividend then add it to the accumulator, as well as adding the powers_of_2 cell value to the answer.
# When the first row has been considered as above, then the integer division of dividend by divisor is given by answer.<br> (And the remainder is given by the absolute value of accumulator - dividend).

;Answer:
So 580 divided by 34 using the Egyptian method is '''<code>17</code>''' remainder (578 - 580) or '''<code>2</code>'''.


;Task:
The task is to create a function that does [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_mathematics#Multiplication_and_division Egyptian division]. The function should<br />
closely follow the description above in using a list/array of powers of two, and<br />
another of doublings.

* Functions should be clear interpretations of the algorithm.
* Use the function to divide 580 by 34 and show the answer '''here, on this page'''.
