This task is similar to:
::* &nbsp; [[Matrix multiplication]]
::* &nbsp; [[Matrix transposition]]


;Task:
Implement basic element-wise matrix-matrix and scalar-matrix operations, which can be referred to in other, higher-order tasks.

Implement:
:::* &nbsp; addition
:::* &nbsp; subtraction
:::* &nbsp; multiplication
:::* &nbsp; division
:::* &nbsp; exponentiation

<br>
Extend the task if necessary to include additional basic operations, which should not require their own specialised task.
