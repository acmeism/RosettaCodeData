Starting with a path to some directory, determine whether the directory is empty.

An empty directory contains no files nor subdirectories. 
With [[Unix]] or [[Windows]] systems, every directory contains an entry for “<code>.</code>” and almost every directory contains “<code>..</code>” (except for a root directory); an empty directory contains no other entries.
