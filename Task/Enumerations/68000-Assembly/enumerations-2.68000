;In this example, load Thursday.

    LEA Days_Of_The_Week,A0   ;load base address of table into A0
    MOVE.W #4,D0              ;Thursday's index
    LSL.W #2,D0               ;multiply by 4 since each pointer is 32-bit
    LEA (A0,D0),A1            ;load table offset by D0 into A1
    MOVE.L (A1),A1            ;dereference the pointer, now the address of "Thursday" is in A1.
    MOVE.B (A1)+,D1           ;Load the "T" of Thursday into D1, auto-increment to next letter for the next load.
