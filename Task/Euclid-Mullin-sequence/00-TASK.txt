;Definition
The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%E2%80%93Mullin_sequence Euclidâ€“Mullin sequence] is an infinite sequence of distinct prime numbers, in which each element is the least prime factor of one plus the product of all earlier elements. 

The first element is usually assumed to be 2. So the second element is : (2) + 1 = 3 and the third element is : (2 x 3) + 1 = 7 as this is prime.

Although intermingled with smaller elements, the sequence can produce very large elements quite quickly and only the first 51 have been computed at the time of writing.

;Task
Compute and show here the first '''16''' elements of the sequence or, if your language does not support arbitrary precision arithmetic, as many as you can.

;Stretch goal
Compute the next '''11''' elements of the sequence.
