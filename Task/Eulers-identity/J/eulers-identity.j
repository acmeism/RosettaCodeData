   NB. Euler's number is the default base for power
   NB. using j's expressive numeric notation:
   1 + ^ 0j1p1
0j1.22465e_16


   NB. Customize the comparison tolerance to 10 ^ (-15)
   NB. to show that
   _1 (=!.1e_15) ^ 0j1p1
1



   TAU =: 2p1

   NB. tauday.com  pi is wrong
   NB. with TAU as 2 pi,
   NB. Euler's identity should have read


   1 (=!.1e_15) ^ j. TAU
1
