This programming task, is to calculate ANY binomial coefficient.

However, it has to be able to output &nbsp; <big><big><math>\binom{5}{3}</math></big></big>, &nbsp; which is &nbsp; '''10'''.

This formula is recommended:
<big><big>
:: <math>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\ldots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\ldots 1}</math>
</big></big>
