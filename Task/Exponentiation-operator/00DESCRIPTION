Most programming languages have a built-in implementation of exponentiation.
Re-implement integer exponentiation for both int<sup>int</sup> and float<sup>int</sup> as both a procedure, and an operator (if your language supports operator definition).

If the language supports operator (or procedure) overloading, then an overloaded form should be provided for both int<sup>int</sup> and float<sup>int</sup> variants.
