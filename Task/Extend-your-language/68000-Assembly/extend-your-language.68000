macro if2_EQ_DOT_L 1,2,3,4
;input: 1 = first param (can be any addressing mode compatible with CMP)
;       2 = second param (used for condition 1)
;       3 = third param (used for condition 2)
;       4 = output for comparison results (must be a data register, and can't be 1, 2, or 3. The macro will not enforce this!)

; <backslash>@ represents a macro-local label that is scoped for each instance of that macro in your program
; and doesn't cause "label already defined" conflicts if the macro is used multiple times
