In [[wp:bioinformatics|bioinformatics]], long character strings are often encoded in a format called [[wp:FASTA format|FASTA]].  

A FASTA file can contain several strings, each identified by a name marked by a <big><big><code>&gt;</code></big></big> (greater than) character at the beginning of the line.


;Task:
Write a program that reads a FASTA file such as:
<pre>
>Rosetta_Example_1
THERECANBENOSPACE
>Rosetta_Example_2
THERECANBESEVERAL
LINESBUTTHEYALLMUST
BECONCATENATED
</pre>
{{out}}
<pre>
Rosetta_Example_1: THERECANBENOSPACE
Rosetta_Example_2: THERECANBESEVERALLINESBUTTHEYALLMUSTBECONCATENATED
</pre>
Note that a high-quality implementation will not hold the entire file in memory at once; real FASTA files can be multiple gigabytes in size.
