The '''Factorial Function''' of a positive integer, ''n'', is defined as the product of the sequence ''n'', ''n''-1, ''n''-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is [[wp:Factorial#Definition|defined]] as being 1.

Write a function to return the factorial of a number.
Solutions can be iterative or recursive.
Support for trapping negative n errors is optional.
