The [[Thue-Morse]] sequence is a sequence of ones and zeros that if two people
take turns in the given order, the first persons turn for every '0' in the
sequence, the second for every '1'; then this is shown to give a fairer, more
equitable sharing of resources. (Football penalty shoot-outs for example, might
not favour the team that goes first as much if the penalty takers take turns
according to the Thue-Morse sequence and took 2^n penalties)

The Thue-Morse sequence of ones-and-zeroes can be generated by:
:''"When counting in binary, the digit sum modulo 2 is the Thue-Morse sequence"''


;Sharing fairly between two or more:
Use this method:
:''When counting base '''b''', the digit sum modulo '''b''' is the Thue-Morse sequence of fairer sharing between '''b''' people.''


;Task
Counting from zero; &nbsp; using a function/method/routine to express an integer count in base '''b''',
<br>sum the digits modulo '''b''' to produce the next member of the Thue-Morse fairshare series for '''b''' people.


Show the first 25 terms of the fairshare sequence:
:* &nbsp; For two people:
:* &nbsp; For three people
:* &nbsp; For five people
:* &nbsp; For eleven people
