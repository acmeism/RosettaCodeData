The purpose of this task is to calculate the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
of an input sequence. <br>
The most general case allows for complex numbers at the input
and results in a sequence of equal length, again of complex numbers.
If you need to restrict yourself to real numbers, the output should
be the magnitude (i.e. sqrt(re²+im²)) of the complex result.

The classic version is the recursive Cooley–Tukey FFT. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley–Tukey_FFT_algorithm Wikipedia] has pseudocode for that.
Further optimizations are possible but not required.
