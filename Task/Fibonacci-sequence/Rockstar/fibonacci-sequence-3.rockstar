The Italian takes a lover, a kiss, a promise
love is population
hate is information
If a lover is love
Give back a kiss

If a lover is hate
Give back a promise

Knock a lover down
Put a promise with a kiss into my heart
Give back The Italian taking a lover, a promise, my heart

Listen to your heart
your mind is everything
your soul is opportunity
Whisper The Italian taking your heart, your mind, your soul
