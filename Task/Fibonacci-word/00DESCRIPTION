The Fibonacci Word may be created in a manner analogous to the Fibonacci Sequence [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/36/79/72/PDF/The_Fibonacci_word_fractal.pdf as described here]:

: Define F_Word<sub>1</sub> as 1;
: Define F_Word<sub>2</sub> as 0;
: Form F_Word<sub>3</sub> as F_Word<sub>2</sub> concatenated with F_Word<sub>1</sub> i.e "01"
: Form F_Word<sub>n</sub> as F_Word<sub>n-1</sub> concatenated with F_word<sub>n-2</sub>

For this task we shall do this for n = 37. You may display the first few but not the larger values of n, doing so will get me into trouble with them what be (again!).

Instead create a table for F_Words 1 to 37 which shows:
:The number of characters in the word
:The word's [[Entropy]].
