;Task:
Create a file called &nbsp; "output.txt", &nbsp; and place in it the contents of the file &nbsp; "input.txt", &nbsp; ''via an intermediate variable''. 

In other words, your program will demonstrate: 
::# &nbsp; how to read from a file into a variable
::# &nbsp; how to write a variable's contents into a file

<br>
Oneliners that skip the intermediate variable are of secondary interest â€” operating systems have copy commands for that.
