In this task, the job is to create a file called "output.txt", and place in it the contents of the file "input.txt", ''via an intermediate variable.'' In other words, your program will demonstrate: (1) how to read from a file into a variable, and (2) how to write a variable's contents into a file. Oneliners that skip the intermediate variable are of secondary interest — operating systems have copy commands for that.
