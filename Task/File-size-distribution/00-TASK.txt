;Task:
Beginning from the current directory, or optionally from a directory specified as a command-line argument, determine how many files there are of various sizes in a directory hierarchy.


My suggestion is to sort by logarithmn of file size, since a few bytes here or there, or even a factor of two or three, may not be that significant.

Don't forget that empty files may exist, to serve as a marker.


Is your file system predominantly devoted to a large number of smaller files, or a smaller number of huge files?
