--Create the original array (table #nos) with numbers from 1 to 10
create table nos (v int);
insert into nos from range(1,11);

--Select the subset that are even into the new array (table #evens)
create table evens as (from nos where v % 2 = 0);

-- Show #evens

# There is no need to drop the tables just for sake of repeating, because
# DuckDB supports "CREATE OR REPLACE", but the basic DROP TABLE syntax
# is the same.
