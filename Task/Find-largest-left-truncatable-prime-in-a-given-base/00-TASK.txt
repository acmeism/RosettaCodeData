A [[Truncatable primes|truncatable prime]] is one where all non-empty substrings that finish at the end of the number (right-substrings) are also primes ''when understood as numbers in a particular base''. The largest such prime in a given (integer) base is therefore computable, provided the base is larger than 2.

Let's consider what happens in base 10. Obviously the right most digit must be prime, so in base 10 candidates are 2,3,5,7. Putting a digit in the range 1 to base-1 in front of each candidate must result in a prime. So 2 and 5, like the whale and the petunias in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', come into existence only to be extinguished before they have time to realize it, because 2 and 5 preceded by any digit in the range 1 to base-1 is not prime. Some numbers formed by preceding 3 or 7 by a digit in the range 1 to base-1 are prime. So 13,17,23,37,43,47,53,67,73,83,97 are candidates. Again, putting a digit in the range 1 to base-1 in front of each candidate must be a prime. Repeating until there are no larger candidates finds the largest left truncatable prime.

Let's work base 3 by hand:

0 and 1 are not prime so the last digit must be 2. 12<sub>3</sub> = 5<sub>10</sub> which is prime, 22<sub>3</sub> = 8<sub>10</sub> which is not so 12<sub>3</sub> is the only candidate. 112<sub>3</sub> = 14<sub>10</sub> which is not prime, 212<sub>3</sub> = 23<sub>10</sub> which is, so 212<sub>3</sub> is the only candidate. 1212<sub>3</sub> = 50<sub>10</sub> which is not prime, 2212<sub>3</sub> = 77<sub>10</sub> which also is not prime. So there are no more candidates, therefore 23 is the largest left truncatable prime in base 3.

The task is to reconstruct as much, and possibly more, of the table in [https://oeis.org/A103443 the OEIS] as you are able.
