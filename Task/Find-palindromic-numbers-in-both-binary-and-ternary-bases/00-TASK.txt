;Task:

* &nbsp; Find and show (in decimal) the first six numbers (non-negative integers) that are &nbsp; [[Palindrome detection|palindromes]] &nbsp; in &nbsp; ''both'':
:::* &nbsp; base 2
:::* &nbsp; base 3
* &nbsp; Display &nbsp; '''0''' &nbsp; (zero) as the first number found, even though some other definitions ignore it.
* &nbsp; Optionally, show the decimal number found in its binary and ternary form.
* &nbsp; Show all output here.


It's permissible to assume the first two numbers and simply list them.
