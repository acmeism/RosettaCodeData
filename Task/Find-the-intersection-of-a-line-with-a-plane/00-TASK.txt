Finding the intersection of an infinite ray with a plane in 3D is an important topic in collision detection.


;Task:
Find the point of intersection for the infinite ray with direction &nbsp; (0,&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;-1) &nbsp; passing through position &nbsp; (0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;10) &nbsp; with the infinite plane with a normal vector of &nbsp; (0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1) &nbsp; and which passes through [0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;5].
