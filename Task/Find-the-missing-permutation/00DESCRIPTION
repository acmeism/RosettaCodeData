These are all of the permutations of the symbols A, B, C and D,
except for one that's not listed.
Find that missing permutation.

(cf. [[Permutations]])

There is an obvious method :
enumerating all permutations of A, B, C, D, and looking for the missing one.

There is an alternate method.
Hint : if all permutations were here,
how many times would A appear in each position ?
What is the parity of this number ?

There is another alternate method.
Hint: if you add up the letter values of each column, does a missing letter A, B, C, D
from each column cause the total value for each column to be unique?
