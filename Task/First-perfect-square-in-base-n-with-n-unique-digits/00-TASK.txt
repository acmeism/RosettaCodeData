Find the first perfect square in a given base '''N''' that has at least '''N''' digits and
exactly '''N''' ''significant unique'' digits when expressed in base '''N'''.

E.G. In base '''10''', the first perfect square with at least '''10''' unique digits is '''1026753849''' ('''32043Â²''').

You may use analytical methods to reduce the search space, but the code must do a search. Do not use magic numbers or just feed the code the answer to verify it is correct.

;Task
