Many big data or scientific programs use boxplots to show distributions of data. &nbsp; In addition, sometimes saving large arrays for boxplots can be impractical and use extreme amounts of RAM. &nbsp; It can be useful to save large arrays as arrays with five numbers to save memory.

For example, the &nbsp; '''R''' &nbsp; programming language implements Tukey's [[wp:Five-number summary|five-number summary]] as the '''[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/fivenum.html fivenum]''' function.


;Task:
Given an array of numbers, compute the five-number summary.


;Note:  
While these five numbers can be used to draw a [[wp:Box plot|boxplot]], &nbsp; statistical packages will typically need extra data. 

Moreover, while there is a consensus about the "box" of the boxplot, &nbsp; there are variations among statistical packages for the whiskers.
