;Task:
Write a program that prints the integers from &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; to &nbsp; '''100''' &nbsp; (inclusive). 


But:
:* &nbsp; for multiples of three, &nbsp; print &nbsp; '''Fizz''' &nbsp; &nbsp; (instead of the number)
:* &nbsp; for multiples of five, &nbsp; print &nbsp; '''Buzz''' &nbsp; &nbsp; (instead of the number)
:* &nbsp; for multiples of both three and five, &nbsp; print &nbsp; '''FizzBuzz''' &nbsp; &nbsp; (instead of the number) 


The &nbsp; ''FizzBuzz'' &nbsp; problem was presented as the lowest level of comprehension required to illustrate adequacy.
