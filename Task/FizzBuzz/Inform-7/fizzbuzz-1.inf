Home is a room.

When play begins:
	repeat with N running from 1 to 100:
		let printed be false;
		if the remainder after dividing N by 3 is 0:
			say "Fizz";
			now printed is true;
		if the remainder after dividing N by 5 is 0:
			say "Buzz";
			now printed is true;
		if printed is false, say N;
		say ".";
	end the story.
