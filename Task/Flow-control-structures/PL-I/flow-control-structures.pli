LEAVE
   The LEAVE statement terminates execution of a loop.
   Execution resumes at the next statement after the loop.
ITERATE
   The ITERATE statement causes the next iteration of the loop to
   commence.  Any statements between ITERATE and the end of the loop
   are not executed.
STOP
   Terminates execution of either a task or the entire program.
SIGNAL FINISH
   Terminates execution of a program in a nice way.
SIGNAL statement
   SIGNAL <condition> raises the named condition.  The condition may
   be one of the hardware or software conditions such as OVERFLOW,
   UNDERFLOW, ZERODIVIDE, SUBSCRIPTRANGE, STRINGRANGE, etc, or a
   user-defined condition.
CALL
   The CALL statement causes control to transfer to the named
   subroutine.
SELECT
   The SELECT statement permits the execution of just one of a
   list of statements (or groups of statements).
   It is sort of like a computed GOTO.
GO TO
   The GO TO statement causes control to be transferred to the named
   statement.
   It can also be used to transfer control to any one of an array of
   labelled statements. (This form is superseded by SELECT, above.)
   [GO TO  can also be spelled as  GOTO].
