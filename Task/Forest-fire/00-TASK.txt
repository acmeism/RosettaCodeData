;Task:
Implement the Drossel and Schwabl definition of the [[wp:Forest-fire model|forest-fire model]].


It is basically a 2D &nbsp; [[wp:Cellular automaton|cellular automaton]] &nbsp; where each cell can be in three distinct states (''empty'', ''tree'' and ''burning'') and evolves according to the following rules (as given by Wikipedia)

# A burning cell turns into an empty cell
# A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning
# A tree ignites with probability &nbsp; <big>''f'' </big> &nbsp; even if no neighbor is burning
# An empty space fills with a tree with probability &nbsp; <big> ''p'' </big>

<br>Neighborhood is the &nbsp; [[wp:Moore neighborhood|Moore neighborhood]]; &nbsp; boundary conditions are so that on the boundary the cells are always empty ("fixed" boundary condition).

At the beginning, populate the lattice with empty and tree cells according to a specific probability (e.g. a cell has the probability 0.5 to be a tree). Then, let the system evolve.

Task's requirements do not include graphical display or the ability to change parameters (probabilities &nbsp; <big> ''p'' </big> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <big> ''f'' </big>) &nbsp; through a graphical or command line interface.
