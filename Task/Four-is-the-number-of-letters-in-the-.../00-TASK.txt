The &nbsp; &nbsp; <big> '''Four is ...''' </big> &nbsp; &nbsp; sequence is based on the counting of the number of
letters in the words of the (never─ending) sentence:
   <big>Four is the number of letters in the first word of this sentence, two in the second,
   three in the third, six in the fourth, two in the fifth, seven in the sixth, ··· </big>


;Definitions and directives:
:* &nbsp; English is to be used in spelling numbers.
:* &nbsp; '''Letters''' &nbsp; are defined as the upper─ and lowercase letters in the Latin alphabet &nbsp; ('''A──►Z''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''a──►z''').
:* &nbsp; Commas are not counted, &nbsp; nor are hyphens (dashes or minus signs).
:* &nbsp; '''twenty─three''' &nbsp; has eleven letters.
:* &nbsp; '''twenty─three''' &nbsp; is considered one word &nbsp; (which is hyphenated).
:* &nbsp; no &nbsp; <big>''' ''and'' '''</big> &nbsp; words are to be used when spelling a (English) word for a number.
:* &nbsp; The American version of numbers will be used here in this task &nbsp; (as opposed to the British version).
          '''2,000,000,000''' &nbsp; is two billion, &nbsp; ''not'' &nbsp; two milliard.


;Task:
:* &nbsp; Write a driver (invoking routine) and a function (subroutine/routine···) that returns the sequence (for any positive integer) of the number of letters in the first &nbsp; '''N'''  &nbsp; words in the never─ending sentence. &nbsp; For instance, the portion of the never─ending sentence shown above (2<sup>nd</sup> sentence of this task's preamble), &nbsp; the sequence would be:
          '''4  2  3  6  2  7'''
:* &nbsp; Only construct as much as is needed for the never─ending sentence.
:* &nbsp; Write a driver (invoking routine) to show the number of letters in the &nbsp; N<sup>th</sup> &nbsp; word, &nbsp; ''as well as'' &nbsp; showing the &nbsp; N<sup>th</sup> &nbsp; word itself.
:* &nbsp; After each test case, show the total number of characters &nbsp; (including blanks, commas, and punctuation) &nbsp; of the sentence that was constructed.
:* &nbsp; Show all output here.


;Test cases:
  Display the first  201  numbers in the sequence &nbsp; (and the total number of characters in the sentence).
  Display the number of letters  (and the word itself)  of the       1,000<sup>th</sup>  word.
  Display the number of letters  (and the word itself)  of the      10,000<sup>th</sup>  word.
  Display the number of letters  (and the word itself)  of the     100,000<sup>th</sup>  word.
  Display the number of letters  (and the word itself)  of the   1,000,000<sup>th</sup>  word.
  Display the number of letters  (and the word itself)  of the  10,000,000<sup>th</sup>  word  (optional).
