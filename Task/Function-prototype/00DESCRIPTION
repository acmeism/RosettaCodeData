Some languages provide the facility to declare functions and subroutines through the use of [[wp:Function prototype|function prototyping]]. The task is to demonstrate the methods available for declaring prototypes within the language. The provided solutions should include:

* An explanation of any placement restrictions for prototype declarations
* A prototype declaration for a function that does not require arguments
* A prototype declaration for a function that requires two arguments
* A prototype declaration for a function that utilizes varargs
* A prototype declaration for a function that utilizes optional arguments
* A prototype declaration for a function that utilizes named parameters
* Example of prototype declarations for subroutines or procedures (if these differ from functions)
* An explanation and example of any special forms of prototyping not covered by the above

Languages that do not provide function prototyping facilities should be omitted from this task.
