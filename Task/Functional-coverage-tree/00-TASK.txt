Functional coverage is a measure of how much a particular function of a system 
has been verified as correct. It is used heavily in tracking the completeness 
of the verification of complex System on Chip (SoC) integrated circuits, where 
it can also be used to track how well the functional ''requirements'' of the 
system have been verified.

This task uses a sub-set of the calculations sometimes used in tracking 
functional coverage but uses a more familiar(?) scenario.

;Task Description:
The head of the clean-up crews for "The Men in a very dark shade of grey when 
viewed at night" has been tasked with managing the cleansing of two properties
after an incident involving aliens.

She arranges the task hierarchically with a manager for the crews working on 
each house who return with a breakdown of how they will report on progress in 
each house.

The overall hierarchy of (sub)tasks is as follows, 
<pre>cleaning
    house1
        bedrooms
        bathrooms
            bathroom1
            bathroom2
            outside lavatory
        attic
        kitchen
        living rooms
            lounge
            dining room
            conservatory
            playroom
        basement
        garage
        garden
    house2
        upstairs
            bedrooms
                suite 1
                suite 2
                bedroom 3
                bedroom 4
            bathroom
            toilet
            attics
        groundfloor
            kitchen
            living rooms
                lounge
                dining room
                conservatory
                playroom
            wet room & toilet
            garage
            garden
            hot tub suite
        basement
            cellars
            wine cellar
            cinema</pre>

The head of cleanup knows that her managers will report fractional completion of leaf tasks (tasks with no child tasks of their own), and she knows that she will want to modify the weight of values of completion as she sees fit.

Some time into the cleaning, and some coverage reports have come in and she thinks see needs to weight the big house2 60-40 with respect to coverage from house1 She prefers a tabular view of her data where missing weights are assumed to be 1.0 and missing coverage 0.0.

;Calculation:
The coverage of a node in the tree is calculated as the [[wp:Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of the coverage of its children evaluated bottom-upwards in the tree.

'''The task is to''' calculate the overall coverage of the cleaning task and display the coverage at all levels of the hierarchy on this page, in a manner that visually shows the hierarchy, weights and coverage of all nodes.

;Extra Credit:
After calculating the coverage for all nodes, one can also calculate the additional/delta top level coverage that would occur if any (sub)task were to be fully covered from its current fractional coverage. This is done by multiplying the extra coverage that could be gained <math>1-coverage</math> for any node, by the product of the `powers` of its parent nodes from the top down to the node.<br>
The power of a direct child of any parent is given by the power of the parent multiplied by the weight of the child divided by the sum of the weights of all the direct children.

The pseudo code would be:

    method delta_calculation(this, power):
        sum_of_weights = sum(node.weight for node in children)
        this.delta  = (1 - this.coverage) * power
        for node in self.children:
            node.delta_calculation(power * node.weight / sum_of_weights)
        return this.delta

Followed by a call to:

    top.delta_calculation(power=1)
