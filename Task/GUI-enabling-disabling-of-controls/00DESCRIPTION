In addition to fundamental [[GUI component interaction]], an application should
dynamically enable and disable GUI components, to give some guidance to the
user, and prohibit (inter)actions which are inappropriate in the current state
of the application.


;Task:
Similar to the task [[GUI component interaction]], write a program
that presents a form with three components to the user:
::# &nbsp; a numeric input field ("Value")
::# &nbsp; a button &nbsp; ("increment")
::# &nbsp; a button &nbsp; ("decrement")

<br>
The field is initialized to zero.
The user may manually enter a new value into the field,
increment its value with the "increment" button,
or decrement the value with the "decrement" button.

The input field should be enabled only when its value is zero.
The "increment" button only as long as the field's value is less then 10:
When the value 10 is reached, the button should go into a disabled state.
Analogously, the "decrement" button should be enabled only as long as
the value is greater than zero.

Effectively, the user can now either increment up to 10, or down to zero.
Manually entering values outside that range is still legal,
but the buttons should reflect that and enable/disable accordingly.
