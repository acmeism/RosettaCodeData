A &nbsp; '''Galton device''' &nbsp; [[wp:Bean_machine|Sir Francis Galton's device]] &nbsp; is also known as a &nbsp; '''bean machine''', &nbsp; a &nbsp; '''Galton Board''', &nbsp; or a &nbsp; '''quincunx'''.


;Description of operation:
In a Galton box, there are a set of pins arranged in a triangular pattern. &nbsp; A number of balls are dropped so that they fall in line with the top pin, deflecting to the left or the right of the pin. &nbsp; The ball continues to fall to the left or right of lower pins before arriving at one of the collection points between and to the sides of the bottom row of pins. 

Eventually the balls are collected into bins at the bottom &nbsp; (as shown in the image), &nbsp; the ball column heights in the bins approximate a &nbsp;  [https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html bell curve]. &nbsp; Overlaying &nbsp; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle Pascal's triangle] &nbsp; onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each bin.


;Task:
Generate an animated simulation of a Galton device.  


;Task requirements:
::* &nbsp; The box should have at least 5 pins on the bottom row.  
::* &nbsp; A solution can use graphics or ASCII animation.  
::* &nbsp; Provide a sample of the output/display such as a screenshot.
::* &nbsp; There can be one or more balls in flight at the same time.  
::* &nbsp; If multiple balls are in flight, ensure they don't interfere with each other.
::* &nbsp; A solution should allow users to specify the number of balls, or it should run until full or a preset limit.  
::* &nbsp; Optionally, &nbsp; display the number of balls.
