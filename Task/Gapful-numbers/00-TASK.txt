Numbers &nbsp; (positive integers expressed in base ten) &nbsp; that are (evenly) divisible by the number formed by the
first and last digit are known as &nbsp; '''gapful numbers'''.


''Evenly divisible'' &nbsp; means divisible with &nbsp; no &nbsp; remainder.


All &nbsp; one─ &nbsp; and two─digit &nbsp; numbers have this property and are trivially excluded. &nbsp; Only
numbers &nbsp; <big> &ge; </big> '''100''' &nbsp; will be considered for this Rosetta Code task.


;Example:
<big>'''187'''</big> &nbsp; is a &nbsp; '''gapful''' &nbsp; number because it is evenly divisible by the
number &nbsp; <big>'''17'''</big> &nbsp; which is formed by the first and last decimal digits
of &nbsp; <big> '''<u>1</u>8<u>7</u>'''. </big>


About &nbsp; <big>7.46%</big> &nbsp; of positive integers are &nbsp; ''gapful''. 


;Task:
:* &nbsp; Generate and show all sets of numbers (below) on one line (horizontally) with a title, &nbsp; here on this page
:* &nbsp; Show the first &nbsp; '''30''' &nbsp; gapful numbers
:* &nbsp; Show the first &nbsp; '''15''' &nbsp; gapful numbers &nbsp; <big> &ge; </big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'''1,000,000'''
:* &nbsp; Show the first &nbsp; '''10''' &nbsp; gapful numbers &nbsp; <big> &ge; </big> &nbsp;                            '''1,000,000,000'''
