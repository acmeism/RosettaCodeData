;Task: 
Generate a random chess position in [[wp:Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation|FEN format]].  

The position does not have to be realistic or even balanced,&nbsp; but it must comply to the following rules:
:* there is one and only one king of each color &nbsp;(one black king and one white king);
:* the kings must not be placed on adjacent squares;
:* there can not be any pawn in the promotion square &nbsp;(no white pawn in the eighth rank, and no black pawn in the first rank);
:* including the kings, up to 32 pieces of either color can be placed. 
:* There is no requirement for material balance between sides. 
:* The picking of pieces does not have to comply to a regular chess set --- there can be five knights, twenty rooks, whatever ... as long as the total number of pieces do not exceed thirty-two.  
:* it is white's turn.
:* It's assumed that both sides have lost castling rights and that there is no possibility for &nbsp; ''en passant'' &nbsp; (the FEN should thus end in <tt>w - - 0 1</tt>).


No requirement is made regarding the probability distribution of your method, but your program should be able to span a reasonably representative sample of all possible positions.  For instance, programs that would always generate positions with say five pieces on the board, or with kings on a corner, would not be considered truly random.
