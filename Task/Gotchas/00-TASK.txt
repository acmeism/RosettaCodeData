;Definition
In programming, a [[wp:Gotcha_(programming)|'''gotcha''']] is a valid construct in a system, program or programming language that works as documented but is counter-intuitive and almost invites mistakes because it is both easy to invoke and unexpected or unreasonable in its outcome.

;Task
Give an example or examples of common gotchas in your programming language and what, if anything, can be done to defend against it or them without using special tools.
