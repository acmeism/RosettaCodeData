;Task:
Given a sequence of integers, find a continuous subsequence which maximizes the sum of its elements, that is, the elements of no other single subsequence add up to a value larger than this one. 


An empty subsequence is considered to have the sum of &nbsp; '''0'''; &nbsp; thus if all elements are negative, the result must be the empty sequence.
