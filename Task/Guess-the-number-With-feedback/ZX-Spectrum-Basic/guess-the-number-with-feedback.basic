ZX Spectrum Basic has no [[:Category:Conditional loops|conditional loop]] constructs, so we have to emulate them here using IF and GO TO.
1 LET n=INT (RND*10)+1
2 INPUT "Guess a number that is between 1 and 10: ",g: IF g=n THEN PRINT "That's my number!": STOP
3 IF g<n THEN PRINT "That guess is too low!": GO TO 2
4 IF g>n THEN PRINT "That guess is too high!": GO TO 2
