Demonstrate how to connect to a web server over HTTPS where that server requires that the client present a certificate to prove who (s)he is. Unlike with the [[HTTPS request with authentication]] task, it is ''not'' acceptable to perform the authentication by a username/password or a set cookie.

This task is in general useful for use with [[Creating a SOAP Client|webservice client]]s as it offers a high level of assurance that the client is an acceptable counterparty for the server. For example, [http://aws.amazon.com/ Amazon Web Services] uses this style of authentication.
