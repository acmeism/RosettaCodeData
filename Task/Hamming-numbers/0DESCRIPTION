[[wp:Hamming_numbers#Algorithms|Hamming numbers]] are numbers of the form
: <math>H = 2^i \cdot 3^j \cdot 5^k, \; \mathrm{where} \; i, j, k \geq 0</math>.
''Hamming numbers'' are also known as ''ugly numbers'' and also ''5-smooth numbers'' &nbsp; (numbers whose prime divisors are less or equal to 5).

Generate the sequence of Hamming numbers, ''in increasing order''. In particular:
# Show the first twenty Hamming numbers.
# Show the 1691st Hamming number (the last one below <math>2^{31}</math>).
# Show the one millionth Hamming number (if the language – or a convenient library – supports arbitrary-precision integers).
