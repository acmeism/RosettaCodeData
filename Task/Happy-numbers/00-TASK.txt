From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:
:: A [[wp:Happy number|happy number]] is defined by the following process:

:: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; (where it will stay), &nbsp; or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include &nbsp; '''1'''. &nbsp; 
<br>

:: Those numbers for which this process end in &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''happy'' &nbsp; numbers, &nbsp; 
:: while &nbsp; those numbers &nbsp; that &nbsp; do &nbsp; <u>not</u> &nbsp; end in &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; are &nbsp; ''unhappy'' &nbsp; numbers.
