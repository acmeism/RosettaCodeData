From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:
:A [[wp:Happy number|happy number]] is defined by the following process:

: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; (where it will stay), &nbsp; or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include &nbsp; '''1'''. &nbsp; Those numbers for which this process ends in &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; are happy numbers, &nbsp; while those that do not end in &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; are unhappy numbers.
