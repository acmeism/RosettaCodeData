The [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarshadNumber.html Harshad] or Niven numbers are positive integers â‰¥ 1 that are divisible by the sum of their digits. 

For example, &nbsp; '''42''' &nbsp; is a [[oeis:A005349|Harshad number]] as &nbsp; '''42''' &nbsp; is divisible by &nbsp; ('''4''' + '''2''') &nbsp; without remainder.

Assume that the series is defined as the numbers in increasing order.


;Task:
The task is to create a function/method/procedure to generate successive members of the Harshad sequence. 

Use it to:
::* &nbsp; list the first '''20''' members of the sequence, &nbsp; and
::* &nbsp; list the first Harshad number greater than '''1000'''.
