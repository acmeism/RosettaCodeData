The [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarshadNumber.html Harshad] or Niven numbers are positive integers ≥ 1 that are divisible by the sum of their digits.

For example, &nbsp; '''42''' &nbsp; is a [[oeis:A005349|Harshad number]] as &nbsp; '''42''' &nbsp; is divisible by &nbsp; ('''4''' + '''2''') &nbsp; without remainder.
<br>Assume that the series is defined as the numbers in increasing order.


;Task:
The task is to create a function/method/procedure to generate successive members of the Harshad sequence.

Use it to list the first twenty members of the sequence and list the first Harshad number greater than 1000.
