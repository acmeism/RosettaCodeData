The [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarshadNumber.html Harshad] or Niven numbers are positive integers >= 1 that are divisible by the sum of their digits. For example, 42 is a [[oeis:A005349|Harshad number]] as 42 is divisible by (4+2) without remainder.
Assume that the series is defined as the numbers in increasing order.

The task is to create a function/method/procedure to generate successive members of the Harshad sequence. Use it to list the first twenty members of the sequence and list the first Harshad number greater than 1000.
