The '''haversine formula''' is an equation important in navigation, giving great-circle distances between two points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes. 

It is a special case of a more general formula  in spherical trigonometry, the '''law of haversines''', relating the sides and angles of spherical "triangles".


;Task:
Implement a great-circle distance function, or use a library function, 
to show the great-circle distance between:
* Nashville International Airport (BNA) &nbsp; in Nashville, TN, USA, &nbsp; which is: 
   <big><big> '''N''' 36°7.2',   '''W''' 86°40.2'     (36.12,   -86.67) </big></big>          -and-
* Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) &nbsp;in Los Angeles, CA, USA, &nbsp; which is:
   <big><big> '''N''' 33°56.4',  '''W''' 118°24.0'    (33.94,  -118.40) </big></big>

User Kaimbridge clarified on the Talk page:

 -- 6371.0 km is the authalic radius based on/extracted from surface area;
 -- 6372.8 km is an approximation of the radius of the average circumference
    (i.e., the average great-elliptic or great-circle radius), where the
     boundaries are the meridian (6367.45 km) and the equator (6378.14 km).

Using either of these values results, of course, in differing distances:

 6371.0 km -> 2886.44444283798329974715782394574671655 km;
 6372.8 km -> 2887.25995060711033944886005029688505340 km;
 (results extended for accuracy check:  Given that the radii are only
  approximations anyways, .01' ≈ 1.0621333 km and .001" ≈ .00177 km,
  practical precision required is certainly no greater than about
  .0000001——i.e., .1 mm!)

As distances are segments of great circles/circumferences, it is
recommended that the latter value (r = 6372.8 km) be used (which
most of the given solutions have already adopted, anyways).

Most of the examples below adopted Kaimbridge's recommended value of
6372.8 km for the earth radius.  However, the derivation of this
[http://math.wikia.com/wiki/Ellipsoidal_quadratic_mean_radius ellipsoidal quadratic mean radius]
is wrong (the averaging over azimuth is biased).  When applying these
examples in real applications, it is better to use the
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius#Mean_radius mean earth radius],
6371 km.  This value is recommended by the International Union of
Geodesy and Geophysics and it minimizes the RMS relative error between the
great circle and geodesic distance.
