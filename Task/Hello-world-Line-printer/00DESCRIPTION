Cause a line printer attached to the computer to print a line containing the message <tt>Hello World!</tt>

'''Note:''' A line printer is not the same as standard output.
A [[wp:line printer|line printer]] was an older-style printer which prints one line at a time to a continuous ream of paper.
With some systems, a line printer can be any device attached to an appropriate port (such as a parallel port).
