;Task:
Guide a new user of a language through the steps necessary
to install the programming language and selection of a [[Editor|text editor]] if needed,
to run the languages' example in the [[Hello world/Text]] task.
* Assume the language-newbie is a programmer in another language.
* Assume the language-newbie is competent in installing software for the platform.
* Assume the language-newbie can use one simple text editor for the OS/platform, (but that may not necessarily be a particular one if the installation needs a particular editor).
* Refer to, (and link to), already existing documentation as much as possible (but provide a summary here).
* Remember to state where to view the output.
* If particular IDE's or editors are required that are not standard, then point to/explain their installation too.


;Note<nowiki>:</nowiki>
* If it is more natural for a language to give output via a GUI or to a file etc, then use that method of output rather than as text to a terminal/command-line, but remember to give instructions on how to view the output generated.
* You may use sub-headings if giving instructions for multiple platforms.
