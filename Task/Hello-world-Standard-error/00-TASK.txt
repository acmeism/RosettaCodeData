A common practice in computing is to send error messages 
to a different output stream than [[User Output - text|normal text console messages]]. 

The normal messages print to what is called "standard output" or "standard out". 

The error messages print to "standard error". 

This separation can be used to redirect error messages to a different place than normal messages.


;Task:
Show how to print a message to standard error by printing &nbsp; &nbsp; '''Goodbye, World!''' &nbsp; &nbsp; on that stream.
