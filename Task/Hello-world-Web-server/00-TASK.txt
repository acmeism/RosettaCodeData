The browser is the new [[GUI]] !


;Task:
Serve our standard text &nbsp; <big><big><code>Goodbye, World!</code></big></big> &nbsp; to &nbsp; http://localhost:8080/ &nbsp; so that it can be viewed with a web browser. 

The provided solution must start or implement a server that accepts multiple client connections and serves text as requested.

Note that starting a web browser or opening a new window with this URL 
is not part of the task. 

Additionally, it is permissible to serve the provided page as a plain text file (there is no requirement to serve properly formatted [[HTML]] here).
