  """Thinking of Holland
    |I see broad rivers
    |slowly chuntering
    |through endless lowlands,
    |rows of implausibly
    |airy poplars
    |standing like tall plumes
    |against the horizon;
    |and sunk in the unbounded
    |vastness of space
    |homesteads and boweries
    |dotted across the land,
    |copses, villages,
    |couchant towers,
    |churches and elm-trees,
    |bound in one great unity.
    |There the sky hangs low,
    |and steadily the sun
    |is smothered in a greyly
    |iridescent smirr,
    |and in every province
    |the voice of water
    |with its lapping disasters
    |is feared and hearkened.""".stripMargin
