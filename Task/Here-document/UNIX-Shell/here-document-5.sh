echo '
In any unix shell, you specify a text block and can use all whitespace like
  (spaces) &    (tab) in it, by using single quotes.
As mentioned above, a Unix "here document" is a type of redirection.
In a literal Bash here document, the starting token must be
quoted, but the end token must not, so they are not the same, which does not
conform to the task definition.
