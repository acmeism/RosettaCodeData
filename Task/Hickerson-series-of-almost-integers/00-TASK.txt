The following function, &nbsp; due to D. Hickerson, &nbsp; is said to generate "Almost integers" by the 
<br>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlmostInteger.html "Almost Integer" page of Wolfram MathWorld], &nbsp; (December 31 2013). &nbsp; (See formula numbered &nbsp; '''51'''.)


The function is: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <math>h(n) = {\operatorname{n}!\over2(\ln{2})^{n+1}}</math>


It is said to produce "almost integers" for &nbsp; '''n''' &nbsp; between &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''17'''.  
The purpose of the task is to verify this assertion.

Assume that an "almost integer" has '''either a nine or a zero as its first digit after the decimal point''' of its decimal string representation


;Task:
Calculate all values of the function checking and stating which are "almost integers".

Note: Use extended/arbitrary precision numbers in your calculation if necessary to ensure you have adequate precision of results as for example:
                h(18) = 3385534663256845326.39...
