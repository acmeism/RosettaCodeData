Humble numbers are positive integers which have &nbsp; no &nbsp; prime factors &nbsp; <big> &gt; </big> &nbsp; '''7'''.


Humble numbers are also called &nbsp; ''7-smooth numbers'', &nbsp; and sometimes called &nbsp; ''highly composite'', 
<br>although this conflicts with another meaning of &nbsp; ''highly composite numbers''.



Another way to express the above is:

  <big><big> humble  =  2<sup>i</sup> &times; 3<sup>j</sup> &times; 5<sup>k</sup> &times; 7<sup>m</sup> </big></big>

            where   <big>  i, j, k, m <big>&ge;</big> 0 </big>
