The &nbsp; [[wp:International_Bank_Account_Number|International Bank Account Number (IBAN)]] &nbsp; is an internationally agreed means of identifying bank accounts across national borders with a reduced risk of propagating [[wp:Transcription_error|transcription errors]]. 

The IBAN consists of up to '''34''' alphanumeric characters: 
::* &nbsp; first the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, 
::* &nbsp; then two check digits, and 
::* &nbsp; finally a country-specific Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN). 


The check digits enable a sanity check of the bank account number to confirm its integrity even before submitting a transaction.


;Task:
Validate the following fictitious IBAN: &nbsp; <tt> GB82 WEST 1234 5698 7654 32 </tt>  


Details of the algorithm can be found on the Wikipedia page.
