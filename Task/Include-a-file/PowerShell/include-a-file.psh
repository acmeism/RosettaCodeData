<#
    A module is a set of related Windows PowerShell functionalities, grouped together as a convenient unit (usually saved in a
    single directory). By defining a set of related script files, assemblies, and related resources as a module, you can
    reference, load, persist, and share your code much easier than you would otherwise.

Import-Module -Name MyModule


<#
    When you dot source a script (or scriptblock), all variables and functions defined in the script (or scriptblock) will
    persist in the shell when the script ends.
