Home is a room.

To decide which indexed text is incremented (T - indexed text):
	let temp be indexed text;
	let temp be the player's command;
	change the text of the player's command to T;
	let N be a number;
	if the player's command matches "[number]":
		let N be the number understood;
	change the text of the player's command to temp;
	decide on "[N + 1]".

When play begins:
	say incremented "12345";
	end the story.
