It is known that the set of finite lists of positive integers is &nbsp; [[wp:countable| <u>countable</u>]].  

This means that there exists a subset of natural integers which can be mapped to the set of finite lists of positive integers.  


;Task:
Implement such a mapping:
:* &nbsp; write a function &nbsp; &nbsp; ''rank'' &nbsp; &nbsp; which assigns an integer to any finite, arbitrarily long list of arbitrary large positive integers.
:* &nbsp; write a function        &nbsp; ''unrank''      &nbsp; which is the &nbsp; ''rank'' &nbsp; [[wp:inverse function| <u>inverse function</u>]].


Demonstrate your solution by:
:* &nbsp; picking a random-length list of random positive integers
:* &nbsp; turn it into an integer, &nbsp; and 
:* &nbsp; get the list back.


There are many ways to do this. &nbsp; Feel free to choose any one you like.


;Extra credit:
Make the &nbsp; ''rank'' &nbsp; function as a &nbsp; [[wp:bijection| <u>bijection</u>]] &nbsp; and show &nbsp; ''unrank(n)'' &nbsp; for &nbsp; <big>'''n'''</big> &nbsp; varying from &nbsp; '''0''' &nbsp; to &nbsp; '''10'''.
