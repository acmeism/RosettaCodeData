Multiple inheritance allows to specify that one [[classes | class]] is a subclass of several other classes. 

Some languages allow multiple [[inheritance]] for arbitrary classes, &nbsp; others restrict it to interfaces, &nbsp; some don't allow it at all.


;Task:
Write two classes (or interfaces) <tt>Camera</tt> and <tt>MobilePhone</tt>, &nbsp; then write a class <tt>CameraPhone</tt> which is both a <tt>Camera</tt> and a <tt>MobilePhone</tt>.

There is no need to implement any functions for those classes.
