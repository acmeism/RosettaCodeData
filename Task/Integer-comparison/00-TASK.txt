Get two integers from the user.

Then, &nbsp; display a message if the first integer is:
::::* &nbsp; less than, 
::::* &nbsp; equal to, &nbsp; or 
::::* &nbsp; greater than
the second integer. 


Test the condition &nbsp; ''for each case separately'', &nbsp; so that &nbsp; ''all three comparison operators are used'' &nbsp; in the code.
