;Task:
Create a program that, when run, would display all integers from &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; to &nbsp; <big><big> ''' <b> &infin; </b> ''' </big></big> &nbsp; (or any relevant implementation limit), &nbsp; in sequence &nbsp; (i.e. &nbsp; 1, 2, 3, 4, etc) &nbsp; if given enough time.


An example may not be able to reach arbitrarily-large numbers based on implementations limits. &nbsp; For example, if integers are represented as a 32-bit unsigned value with 0 as the smallest representable value, the largest representable value would be 4,294,967,295. &nbsp; Some languages support arbitrarily-large numbers as a built-in feature, while others make use of a module or library.

If appropriate, provide an example which reflect the language implementation's common built-in limits as well as an example which supports arbitrarily large numbers, and describe the nature of such limitationsâ€”or lack thereof.
