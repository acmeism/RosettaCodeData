Create a program that, when run, would display all integers from 1 to ∞ (or any relevant implementation limit), in sequence (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc) if given enough time.

An example may not be able to reach arbitrarily-large numbers based on implementations limits. For example, if integers are represented as a 32-bit unsigned value with 0 as the smallest representable value, the largest representable value would be 4,294,967,295. Some languages support arbitrarily-large numbers as a built-in feature, while others make use of a module or library.

If appropriate, provide an example which reflect the language implementation's common built-in limits as well as an example which supports arbitrarily large numbers, and describe the nature of such limitations—or lack thereof.
