@ An ARM program that keeps incrementing R0 forever
@
@ If desired, a call to some 'PRINT' routine --
@ which would depend on the OS -- could be included

main:
        mov   r0,   #0          @ start with R0 = 0

repeat:
        @ call to 'PRINT' routine
        add   r0,   r0,   #1    @ increment R0
        b     repeat            @ unconditional branch
