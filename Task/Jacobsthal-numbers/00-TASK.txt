'''Jacobsthal numbers''' are an integer sequence related to Fibonacci numbers. Similar to Fibonacci, where each term is the sum of the previous two terms, each term is the sum of the previous, plus twice the one before that. Traditionally the sequence starts with the given terms 0, 1.

 <span style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;">
    J<sub>0</sub> = 0
    J<sub>1</sub> = 1
    J<sub>n</sub> = J<sub>n-1</sub> + 2 Ã— J<sub>n-2</sub>
 </span>

Terms may be calculated directly using one of several possible formulas:
 <span style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;">
    J<sub>n</sub> = ( 2<sup>n</sup> - (-1)<sup>n</sup> ) / 3
 </span>


'''Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers''' are very similar. They have the same recurrence relationship, the only difference is an initial starting value '''J<sub>0</sub> = 2''' rather than '''J<sub>0</sub> = 0'''.

Terms may be calculated directly using one of several possible formulas:
    <span style="font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;">
    JL<sub>n</sub> = 2<sup>n</sup> + (-1)<sup>n</sup>
    </span>

'''Jacobsthal oblong numbers''' is the sequence obtained from multiplying each '''Jacobsthal number''' '''J<sub>n</sub>''' by its direct successor '''J<sub>n+1</sub>'''.


'''Jacobsthal primes''' are '''Jacobsthal numbers''' that are prime.
