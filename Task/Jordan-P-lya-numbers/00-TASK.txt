'''Jordan-Pólya numbers''' (or '''J-P numbers''' for short) are the numbers that can be obtained by multiplying together one or more (not necessarily distinct) factorials.

;Example
480 is a J-P number because 480 = 2! x 2! x 5!.

;Task
Find and show on this page the first '''50''' J-P numbers.

What is the largest J-P number less than '''100 million'''?

;Bonus
Find and show on this page the '''800'''th, '''1,800'''th, '''2,800'''th and '''3,800'''th J-P numbers and also show their decomposition into factorials in highest to lowest order. Optionally, do the same for the '''1,050'''th J-P number.

Where there is more than one way to decompose a J-P number into factorials, choose the way which uses the largest factorials.

Hint: These J-P numbers are all less than 2^53.
