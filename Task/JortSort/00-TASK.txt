JortSort is a sorting tool set that makes the user do the work and guarantees efficiency because you don't have to sort ever again.

JortSort is a function that takes a single array of comparable objects as its argument. 

It then sorts the array in ascending order and compares the sorted array to the originally provided array. 

If the arrays match &nbsp; (i.e. the original array was already sorted), &nbsp; the function returns &nbsp; '''true'''. 

If the arrays do not match (i.e. the original array was not sorted), the function returns &nbsp; '''false'''.
