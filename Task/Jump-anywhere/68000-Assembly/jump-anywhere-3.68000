;For this example, we want to execute "ReadJoystick"
MOVE.W D0,#1
JSR Retpoline
;;;;; ReadJoystick's RTS will return the program counter to here
; rest of program


;assume this is somewhere far away from the JSR above, and that execution won't fall through to here.
Retpoline:         ;uses D0 as the index into the table.
LEA A0,SubroutineTable
LSL.B #2,D0        ;multiply D0 by 4 since this is a table of 32-bit memory addresses
MOVE.L (A0,D0),A0  ;offset and deference A0, now A0 contains the address of ReadJoystick
PEA A0             ;push the address of A0 onto the stack
RTS                ;now we'll "return" to ReadJoystick. If it ends in an RTS, that RTS shall return to the area specified above.

SubroutineTable:
DC.L MoveMouse, DC.L ReadJoystick, DC.L ReadKeyboard, DC.L PrintString
