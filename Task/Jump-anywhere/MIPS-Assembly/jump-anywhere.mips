j GoHere             ;the assembler will convert this label to a constant memory address for us.

nop                  ;     branch delay slot. This instruction would get executed DURING the jump.
                     ;     But since NOP intentionally does nothing, it's not a problem.

GoHere:
addiu $t0,1  ;this instruction is the first one executed after jumping.
