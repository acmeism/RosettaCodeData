[[w:Brian Kernighan|Brian Kernighan]], in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg4U4r_AgJU lecture] at the University of Nottingham, described a [https://youtu.be/Sg4U4r_AgJU?t=50s problem] on which this task is based.

;Problem:
You are given a a data file of thousands of lines; each of three `whitespace` separated fields: a date, a one word name and the magnitude of the event.

Example lines from the file would be lines like:
<pre>8/27/1883    Krakatoa            8.8
5/18/1980    MountStHelens       7.6
3/13/2009    CostaRica           5.1</pre>

;Task:
* Create a program or script invocation to find all the events with magnitude greater than 6
* Assuming an appropriate name e.g. "data.txt" for the file:
:# Either: Show how your program is invoked to process a data file of that name.
:# Or: Incorporate the file name into the program, (as it is assumed that the program is single use).
