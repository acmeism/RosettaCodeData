[[user input::task| ]]
Obtain a valid Y or N response from the [[input device::keyboard]]. The keyboard should be flushed, so that any outstanding keypresses are removed, preventing any existing Y or N keypress from being evaluated. The response should be obtained as soon as Y or N are pressed, and there should be no need to press an enter key.
