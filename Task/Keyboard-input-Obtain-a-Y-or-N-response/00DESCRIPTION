[[user input::task| ]]

;Task:
Obtain a valid &nbsp; '''Y''' &nbsp; or &nbsp; '''N''' &nbsp; response from the [[input device::keyboard]].

The keyboard should be flushed, so that any outstanding key-presses are removed, preventing any existing &nbsp; '''Y''' &nbsp; or &nbsp; '''N''' &nbsp; key-press from being evaluated.

The response should be obtained as soon as &nbsp; '''Y''' &nbsp; or &nbsp; '''N''' &nbsp; are pressed, and there should be no need to press an &nbsp; enter &nbsp; key.
