Show how to link user defined methods to user defined keys. 
 
An example of this is the facility provided by emacs for [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Key-Bindings.html key bindings]. 

These key bindings may be application-specific or system-wide; state which you have done.
