;Task
[[wp:Knight%27s_tour|Problem]]: you have a standard 8x8 chessboard, empty but for a single knight on some square.   Your task is to emit a series of legal knight moves that result in the knight visiting every square on the chessboard exactly once. Note that it is ''not'' a requirement that the tour be "closed"; that is, the knight need not end within a single move of its start position.

Input and output may be textual or graphical, according to the conventions of the programming environment.  If textual, squares should be indicated in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_chess_notation algebraic notation].  The output should indicate the order in which the knight visits the squares, starting with the initial position.  The form of the output may be a diagram of the board with the squares numbered according to visitation sequence, or a textual list of algebraic coordinates in order, or even an actual animation of the knight moving around the chessboard.

Input: starting square

Output: move sequence
