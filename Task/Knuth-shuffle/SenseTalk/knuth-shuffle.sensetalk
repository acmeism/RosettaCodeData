set list to 1..9 -- a range, will become a list as needed
set last to the number of items in list

repeat with i = last down to 2 -- in SenseTalk, the first index in a list is 1
	set j = random (1,i-1)
	set [item i of list, item j of list] to [item j of list, item i of list] -- swap items
end repeat

put list
