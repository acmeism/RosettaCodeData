A certain children's game involves starting with a word in a particular category. &nbsp; Each participant in turn says a word, but that word must begin with the final letter of the previous word. &nbsp; Once a word has been given, it cannot be repeated. &nbsp; If an opponent cannot give a word in the category, they fall out of the game. 


For example, with &nbsp; "animals" &nbsp; as the category,
<pre>
Child 1: dog 
Child 2: goldfish
Child 1: hippopotamus
Child 2: snake
...
</pre>


;Task:
Take the following selection of 70 English Pokemon names &nbsp; (extracted from &nbsp; [[wp:List of Pok√©mon|Wikipedia's list of Pokemon]]) &nbsp; and generate the/a sequence with the highest possible number of Pokemon names where the subsequent name starts with the final letter of the preceding name. 

No Pokemon name is to be repeated.
