A certain childrens game involves starting with a word in a particular category. Each participant in turn says a word, but that word must begin with the final letter of the previous word. Once a word has been given, it cannot be repeated. If an opponent cannot give a word in the category, they fall out of the game. For example, with "animals" as the category,

<pre>Child 1: dog
Child 2: goldfish
Child 1: hippopotamus
Child 2: snake
...
</pre>
