A Latin Square is in its reduced form if the first row and first column contain items in their natural order. The order n is the number of items. For any given n there is a set of reduced Latin Squares whose size increases rapidly with n. g is a number which identifies a unique element within the set of reduced Latin Squares of order n. The objective of this task is to construct the set of all Latin Squares of a given order and to provide a means which given suitable values for g any element within the set may be obtained.

For a reduced Latin Square the first row is always 1 to n. The second row is all [[Permutations/Derangements]] of 1 to n starting with 2. The third row is all [[Permutations/Derangements]] of 1 to n starting with 3 which do not clash (do not have the same item in any column) with row 2. The fourth row is all [[Permutations/Derangements]] of 1 to n starting with 4 which do not clash with rows 2 or 3. Likewise continuing to the nth row.

Demonstrate by:
* displaying the four reduced Latin Squares of order 4.
* for n = 1 to 6 (or more) produce the set of reduced Latin Squares; produce a table which shows the size of the set of reduced Latin Squares and compares this value times n! times (n-1)! with the values in [[oeis:A002860|OEIS A002860]].
