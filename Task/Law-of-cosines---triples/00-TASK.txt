The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines Law of cosines] states that for an angle γ, (gamma) of any triangle, if the sides adjacent to the angle are A and B and the side opposite is C; then the lengths of the sides are related by this formula:
          <big>  <code>A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> - 2ABcos(γ) = C<sup>2</sup></code> </big>

;Specific angles:
For an angle of of &nbsp; '''90º''' &nbsp; this becomes the more familiar "Pythagoras equation":
          <big>  <code>A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup>  =  C<sup>2</sup></code>           </big>

For an angle of &nbsp; '''60º''' &nbsp; this becomes the less familiar  equation:
          <big>  <code>A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> - AB  =  C<sup>2</sup></code>       </big>

And finally for an angle of &nbsp; '''120º''' &nbsp; this becomes the equation:
          <big>  <code>A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> + AB  =  C<sup>2</sup></code>      </big>


;Task:
* &nbsp; Find all integer solutions (in order) to the three specific cases, distinguishing between each angle being considered.
* &nbsp; Restrain all sides to the integers &nbsp; '''1..13''' &nbsp; inclusive.
* &nbsp; Show how many results there are for each of the three angles mentioned above.
* &nbsp; Display results on this page.


Note: Triangles with the same length sides but different order are to be treated as the same. 

;Optional Extra credit:
* How many 60° integer triples are there for sides in the range 1..10_000 ''where the sides are not all of the same length''.
