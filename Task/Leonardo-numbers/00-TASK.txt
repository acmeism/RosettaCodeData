''Leonardo numbers'' &nbsp; are also known as the &nbsp; ''Leonardo series''.


The &nbsp; '''Leonardo numbers''' &nbsp; are a sequence of numbers defined by:
  <big>      L(0) = 1                                          [1<sup>st</sup> equation]  </big>
  <big>      L(1) = 1                                          [2<sup>nd</sup> equation]  </big>
  <big>      L(n) = L(n-1)  +    L(n-2)   +  1                 [3<sup>rd</sup> equation]  </big>
                     ─── also ───
  <big>      L(n) =      2  *  Fib(n+1)   -  1                 [4<sup>th</sup> equation]  </big>

:::: &nbsp; where the &nbsp; '''+ 1''' &nbsp; will herein be known as the &nbsp; ''add'' &nbsp; number.
:::: &nbsp; where the &nbsp; '''FIB''' &nbsp; is the &nbsp; [[wp:Fibonacci number|Fibonacci number]]s.


This task will be using the 3<sup>rd</sup> equation (above) to calculate the Leonardo numbers.


[[wp:Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger W. Dijkstra]] &nbsp; used &nbsp; Leonardo numbers &nbsp; as an integral part of
his &nbsp; [[wp:smoothsort|smoothsort]] &nbsp; [[wp:algorithm|algorithm]].

                                                               -->

The first few Leonardo numbers are:
    ''' 1   1   3   5   9   15   25   41   67   109   177   287   465   753   1219   1973   3193   5167   8361  ··· '''


;Task:
::* &nbsp; show the 1<sup>st</sup> &nbsp; '''25''' &nbsp; Leonardo numbers, starting at '''L(0)'''.
::* &nbsp; allow the first two Leonardo numbers to be specified &nbsp; [for '''L(0)''' and '''L(1)'''].
::* &nbsp; allow the &nbsp; ''add'' &nbsp; number to be specified &nbsp; ('''1''' is the default).
::* &nbsp; show the 1<sup>st</sup> &nbsp; '''25''' &nbsp; Leonardo numbers, specifying '''0''' and '''1''' for '''L(0)''' and '''L(1)''', and '''0''' for the ''add'' number.

(The last task requirement will produce the Fibonacci numbers.)
