The [[Levenshtein distance]] algorithm returns the number of atomic operations (insertion, deletion or edition) that must be performed on a string in order to obtain an other one, but it does not say anything about the actual operations used or their order.

An alignment is a notation used to describe the operations used to turn a string into an other.  At some point in the strings, the minus character ('-') is placed in order to signify that a character must be added at this very place.  For instance, an alignment between the words 'place' and 'palace' is:

<pre>
P-LACE
PALACE
</pre>


;Task:
Write a function that shows the alignment of two strings for the corresponding levenshtein distance.  

As an example, use the words "rosettacode" and "raisethysword".

You can either implement an algorithm, or use a dedicated library (thus showing us how it is named in your language).
