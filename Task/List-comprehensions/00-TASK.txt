A [[wp:List_comprehension|list comprehension]] is a special syntax in some programming languages to describe lists. It is similar to the way mathematicians describe sets, with a ''set comprehension'', hence the name.

Some attributes of a list comprehension are:
# They should be distinct from (nested) for loops and the use of map and filter functions within the syntax of the language.
# They should return either a list or an iterator (something that returns successive members of a collection, in order).
# The syntax has parts corresponding to that of [[wp:Set-builder_notation|set-builder notation]].  


;Task:
Write a list comprehension that builds the list of all [[Pythagorean triples]] with elements between &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''n'''. 

If the language has multiple ways for expressing such a construct (for example, direct list comprehensions and generators), write one example for each.
