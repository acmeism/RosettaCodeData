	fmovecr.x #0,fp0	; now fp0 contains pi
	fmovecr.x #$0c,fp1	; now fp1 contains e

	; you can also define constants in several formats
extended:	dc.x 2.0	; extended precision, 80-bits in the FPU but stored as 96-bits in memory
doublep:	dc.d 2.0	; 64-bit double precision
singlep:	dc.s 2.0	; 32-bit single precision
packedbcd:	dc.p 2.0	; a 96-bit packed BCD format

	; they can be loaded with the corresponding instructions, e.g.
	fmove.p packedbcd,fp2
