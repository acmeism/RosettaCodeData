Some programming languages have ways of expressing integer literals in bases other than the normal base ten.


;Task:
Show how integer literals can be expressed in as many bases as your language allows.


Note: &nbsp; this should '''not''' involve the calling of any functions/methods, but should be interpreted by the compiler or interpreter as an integer written to a given base.

Also show any other ways of expressing literals, e.g. for different types of integers.
