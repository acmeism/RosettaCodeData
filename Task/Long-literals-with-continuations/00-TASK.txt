This task is about writing a computer program that has long literals &nbsp; (character
literals that may require specifying the words/tokens on more than one (source)
line, &nbsp; either with continuations or some other method, such as abutments or
concatenations &nbsp; (or some other mechanisms).


The literal is to be in the form of a "list", &nbsp;  a literal that contains many
words (tokens) separated by a blank (space), &nbsp; in this case &nbsp; (so as to have a
common list), &nbsp; the (English) names of the chemical elements of the periodic table.


The list is to be in (ascending) order of the (chemical) element's atomic number:

 ''hydrogen helium lithium beryllium boron carbon nitrogen oxygen fluorine neon sodium aluminum silicon ...''

... up to the last known (named) chemical element &nbsp; (at this time).


Do not include any of the &nbsp; "unnamed" &nbsp; chemical element names such as:

 ''ununennium unquadnilium triunhexium penthextrium penthexpentium septhexunium octenntrium ennennbium''


To make computer programming languages comparable, &nbsp; the statement widths should be
restricted <u>to less than</u> &nbsp; '''81''' &nbsp; bytes (characters), &nbsp; or less
if a computer programming language has more restrictive limitations or standards.

Also mention what column the programming statements can start in if &nbsp; ''not'' &nbsp;
in column one.


The list &nbsp; ''may'' &nbsp; have leading/embedded/trailing blanks during the
declaration &nbsp; (the actual program statements), &nbsp; this allows the list to be
more readable. &nbsp; The "final" list shouldn't have any leading/trailing or superfluous
blanks &nbsp; (when stored in the program's "memory").

This list should be written with the idea in mind that the
program &nbsp; ''will'' &nbsp; be updated, &nbsp; most likely by someone other than the
original author, &nbsp; as there will be newer (discovered) elements of the periodic
table being added &nbsp; (possibly in the near future). &nbsp; These future updates
should be one of the primary concerns in writing these programs and it should be "easy"
for someone else to add chemical elements to the list &nbsp; (within the computer
program).

Attention should be paid so as to not exceed the &nbsp; ''clause length'' &nbsp; of
continued or specified statements, &nbsp; if there is such a restriction. &nbsp; If the
limit is greater than (say) 4,000 bytes or so, &nbsp; it needn't be mentioned here.


;Task:
:* &nbsp; Write a computer program (by whatever name) to contain a list of the known elements.
:* &nbsp; The program should eventually contain a long literal of words &nbsp; (the elements).
:* &nbsp; The literal should show how one could create a long list of blank-delineated words.
:* &nbsp; The "final" (stored) list should only have a single blank between elements.
:* &nbsp; Try to use the most idiomatic approach(es) in creating the final list.
:* &nbsp; Use continuation if possible, and/or show alternatives &nbsp; (possibly using concatenation).
:* &nbsp; Use a program comment to explain what the continuation character is if it isn't obvious.
:* &nbsp; The program should contain a variable that has the date of the last update/revision.
:* &nbsp; The program, when run, should display with verbiage:
:::* &nbsp; The last update/revision date &nbsp; (and should be unambiguous).
:::* &nbsp; The number of chemical elements in the list.
:::* &nbsp; The name of the highest (last) element name.
