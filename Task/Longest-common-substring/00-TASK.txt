;Task:
Write a function that returns the longest common substring of two strings. 

Use it within a program that demonstrates sample output from the function, which will consist of the longest common substring between "thisisatest" and "testing123testing". 

Note that substrings are consecutive characters within a string. &nbsp; This distinguishes them from subsequences, which is any sequence of characters within a string, even if there are extraneous characters in between them. 

Hence, the [[longest common subsequence]] between "thisisatest" and "testing123testing" is "tsitest", whereas the longest common sub''string'' is just "test".
