Calculate and show here a [[wp:Longest increasing subsequence|longest increasing subsequence]] of the list:
:<math>\{3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1\}</math>
And of the list:
:<math>\{0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15\}</math>

Note that a list may have more than one subsequence that is of the maximum length.
