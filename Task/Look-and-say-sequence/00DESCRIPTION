The &nbsp; [[wp:Look and say sequence|Look and say sequence]] &nbsp; is a recursively defined sequence of numbers studied most notably by &nbsp; [[wp:John Horton Conway|John Conway]].


The  &nbsp; '''look-and-say sequence''' &nbsp; is also known as the &nbsp; '''Morris Number Sequence''', &nbsp; after cryptographer Robert Morris, &nbsp; and the puzzle  &nbsp; ''What is the next number in the sequence 1, &nbsp; 11, &nbsp; 21, &nbsp; 1211, &nbsp; 111221?'' &nbsp; is sometimes referred to as the ''Cuckoo's Egg'', &nbsp; from a description of Morris in Clifford Stoll's book &nbsp; ''The Cuckoo's Egg''.


'''Sequence Definition'''
* Take a decimal number
* ''Look'' at the number, visually grouping consecutive runs of the same digit.
* ''Say'' the number, from left to right, group by group; as how many of that digit there are - followed by the digit grouped.
: This becomes the next number of the sequence.


'''An example:'''
* Starting with the number 1, &nbsp; you have ''one'' 1 which produces 11
* Starting with 11, &nbsp; you have ''two'' 1's. &nbsp; I.E.: &nbsp; 21
* Starting with 21, &nbsp; you have ''one'' 2, then ''one'' 1. &nbsp; I.E.: &nbsp; (12)(11) which becomes 1211
* Starting with 1211, &nbsp; you have ''one'' 1, ''one'' 2, then ''two'' 1's. &nbsp; I.E.: &nbsp; (11)(12)(21) which becomes 111221
