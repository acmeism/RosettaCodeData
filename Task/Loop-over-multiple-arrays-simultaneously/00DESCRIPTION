Loop over multiple arrays (or lists or tuples or whatever they're called in
your language) and print the ''i''th element of each.
Use your language's "for each" loop if it has one, otherwise iterate
through the collection in order with some other loop.

For this example, loop over the arrays <code>(a,b,c)</code>,
<code>(A,B,C)</code> and <code>(1,2,3)</code>
to produce the output
<pre>aA1
bB2
cC3</pre>

If possible, also describe what happens when the arrays are of different lengths.
