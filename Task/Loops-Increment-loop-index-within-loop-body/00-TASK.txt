Sometimes, one may need &nbsp; (or want) &nbsp; a loop which
its &nbsp; ''iterator'' &nbsp; (the index
variable) &nbsp; is modified within the 
<br>loop body &nbsp; '' in addition to the normal incrementation by the &nbsp; ('''do''') &nbsp; loop structure index''.


;Goal:
Demonstrate the best way to accomplish this.


<!-- ··· with a nod to Douglas Adams  (42 being the ultimate answer to THE question). !-->

;Task:
Write a loop which:
::* &nbsp; starts the index (variable) at &nbsp; '''42'''
::* &nbsp; (at iteration time) &nbsp; increments the index by unity
::* &nbsp; if the index is prime:
::::* &nbsp; displays the count of primes found (so far) and the prime &nbsp; (to the terminal)
::::* &nbsp; increments the index such that the new index is now the (old) index plus that prime
::* &nbsp; terminates the loop when &nbsp; '''42''' &nbsp; primes are shown


Extra credit: &nbsp; because of the primes get rather large, use commas
within the displayed primes to ease comprehension.

;Note:
Not all programming languages allow the modification of a
loop's index. &nbsp; If that is the case, then use whatever method that
is appropriate or idiomatic for that language. &nbsp; Please add a note
if the loop's index isn't modifiable.
