Quite often one needs loops which, in the last iteration, execute only part of the loop body.


;Goal:
Demonstrate the best way to do this.


;Task:
Write a loop which writes the comma-separated list
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
using separate output statements for the number 
and the comma from within the body of the loop.
