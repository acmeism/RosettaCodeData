Quite often one needs loops which, in the last iteration,
execute only part of the loop body. pas
The goal of this task is to demonstrate the best way to do this.

Write a loop which writes the comma-separated list
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
using separate output statements for the number
and the comma from within the body of the loop.
