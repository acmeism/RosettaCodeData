Show a nested loop which searches a two-dimensional array filled with random numbers uniformly distributed over <math>[1,\ldots,20]</math>. The loops iterate rows and columns of the array printing the elements until the value <math>20</math> is met. Specifically, this task also shows how to [[Loop/Break|break]] out of nested loops.
