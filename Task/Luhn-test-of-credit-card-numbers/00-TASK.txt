The [[wp:Luhn algorithm|Luhn test]] is used by some credit card companies to distinguish valid credit card numbers from what could be a random selection of digits.

Those companies using credit card numbers that can be validated by the Luhn test have numbers that pass the following test:
#  Reverse the order of the digits in the number.
#  Take the first, third, ... and every other odd digit in the reversed digits and sum them to form the partial sum s1
#  Taking the second, fourth ... and every other even digit in the reversed digits:
:#  Multiply each digit by two and sum the digits if the answer is greater than nine to form partial sums for the even digits
:#  Sum the partial sums of the even digits to form s2
# If s1 + s2 ends in zero then the original number is in the form of a valid credit card number as verified by the Luhn test.

<br>
For example, if the trial number is 49927398716:
<pre>Reverse the digits:
  61789372994
Sum the odd digits:
  6 + 7 + 9 + 7 + 9 + 4 = 42 = s1
The even digits:
    1,  8,  3,  2,  9
  Two times each even digit:
    2, 16,  6,  4, 18
  Sum the digits of each multiplication:
    2,  7,  6,  4,  9
  Sum the last:
    2 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 9 = 28 = s2

s1 + s2 = 70 which ends in zero which means that 49927398716 passes the Luhn test</pre>


;Task:
Write a function/method/procedure/subroutine that will validate a number with the Luhn test, and 
<br>use it to validate the following numbers:
    49927398716
    49927398717
    1234567812345678
    1234567812345670
