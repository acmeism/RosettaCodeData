Every connected device around the world comes with a unique Media Access Control address, or a &nbsp; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address MAC address]. 

A common task a network administrator may come across is being able to identify a network device's manufacturer when given only a MAC address.


;Task:
Interface with one (or numerous) APIs that exist on the internet and retrieve the device manufacturer based on a supplied MAC address.

A MAC address that does not return a valid result should return the String "N/A". &nbsp; An error related to the network connectivity or the API should return a null result.
