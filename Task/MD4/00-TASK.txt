Find the MD4 message digest of a string of [[octet]]s. 
Use the ASCII encoded string “<tt>Rosetta Code</tt>” (without quotes). 
You may either call an MD4 library, or implement MD4 in your language.

'''MD4''' is an obsolete hash function that computes a 128-bit message digest that sometimes appears in obsolete protocols.

RFC 1320 specifies the MD4 algorithm. RFC 6150 declares that MD4 is obsolete.
