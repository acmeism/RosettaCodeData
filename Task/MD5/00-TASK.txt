;Task:
Encode a string using an MD5 algorithm. &nbsp; The algorithm can be found on &nbsp; [[wp:Md5#Algorithm|Wikipedia]].


Optionally, validate your implementation by running all of the test values in &nbsp; [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321 IETF RFC (1321) &nbsp; for MD5]. 

Additionally, &nbsp; RFC 1321 &nbsp; provides more precise information on the algorithm than the Wikipedia article.

{{alertbox|lightgray|'''Warning:''' &nbsp; MD5 has [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6151 known weaknesses], including '''collisions''' and [http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ forged signatures]. &nbsp; Users may consider a stronger alternative when doing production-grade cryptography, such as SHA-256 (from the SHA-2 family), or the upcoming SHA-3.}}

If the solution on this page is a library solution, see &nbsp; [[MD5/Implementation]] &nbsp; for an implementation from scratch.
