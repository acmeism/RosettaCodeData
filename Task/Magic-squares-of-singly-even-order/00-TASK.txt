A [[wp:Magic_square|magic square]] is an '''NxN''' square matrix whose numbers consist of consecutive numbers arranged so that the sum of each row and column, ''and'' both diagonals are equal to the same sum (which is called the ''magic number'' or ''magic constant''). 

A  magic square of singly even order has a size that is a multiple of 4, plus 2 (e.g. 6, 10, 14). This means that the subsquares have an odd size, which plays a role in the construction.
