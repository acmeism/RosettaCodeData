Create a simple version of the board game: &nbsp; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game) Mastermind].

It must be possible to:
:* &nbsp; choose the number of colors will be used in the game (2 - 20)
:* &nbsp; choose the color code length (4 - 10)
:* &nbsp; choose the maximum number of guesses the player has (7 - 20)
:* &nbsp; choose whether or not colors may be repeated in the code

<br>
The (computer program) game should display all the player guesses and the results of that guess.

Display (just an idea):
:::::: {| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Feature !! Graphic Version !! Text Version 
|-
| Player guess
| Colored circles
| Alphabet letters
|-
|Correct color & position
|Black circle 
|X
|-
|Correct color
|White circle 
|O
|-
|None
|Gray circle 
| -
|-
|}


A text version example: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <big> 1. &nbsp; ADEF &nbsp; - &nbsp; XXO- </big>
<br>Translates to:
<br>the first guess;
<br>the four colors (ADEF);
<br>result: 
:::: two correct colors and spot, 
:::: one correct color/wrong spot, one color isn't in the code.

Happy coding!
