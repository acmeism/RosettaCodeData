;Task:
For a maze generated by [[Maze generation|this task]], write a function 
that finds (and displays) the shortest path between two cells. 


Note that because these mazes are generated by the [[wp:Maze_generation_algorithm#Depth-first_search|Depth-first search]] algorithm, they contain no circular paths, 
and a simple depth-first tree search can be used.
