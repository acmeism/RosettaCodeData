From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem#McNugget_numbers Wikipedia]:

 The McNuggets version of the coin problem was introduced by Henri Picciotto,
 who included it in his algebra textbook co-authored with Anita Wah. Picciotto
 thought of the application in the 1980s while dining with his son at
 McDonald's, working the problem out on a napkin. A McNugget number is
 the total number of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets in any number of boxes.
 In the United Kingdom, the original boxes (prior to the introduction of
 the Happy Meal-sized nugget boxes) were of 6, 9, and 20 nuggets.

;Task:
Calculate (from 0 up to a limit of 100) the largest non-McNuggets
number (a number ''n'' which cannot be expressed with ''6x + 9y + 20z = n''
where ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' are natural numbers).
