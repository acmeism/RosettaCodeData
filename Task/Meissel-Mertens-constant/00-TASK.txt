;Task:
Calculate Meissel–Mertens constant up to a precision your language can handle.


;Motivation:
Analogous to Euler's constant, which is important in determining the sum of reciprocal natural numbers, Meissel-Mertens' constant is important in calculating the sum of reciprocal primes.


;Example:
We consider the finite sum of reciprocal natural numbers:

''1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 ... 1/n''

this sum can be well approximated with:

''log(n) + E''  

where ''E'' denotes Euler's constant: 0.57721...
 
''log(n)'' denotes the natural logarithm of ''n''.


Now consider the finite sum of reciprocal primes:

''1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/11 ... 1/p''

this sum can be well approximated with:

''log( log(p) ) + M''

where ''M'' denotes Meissel-Mertens constant: 0.26149...
