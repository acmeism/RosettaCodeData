;Task:
Given a prompt and a list containing a number of strings of which one is to be selected, create a function that:

* prints a textual menu formatted as an index value followed by its corresponding string for each item in the list;
* prompts the user to enter a number;
* returns the string corresponding to the selected index number.

<br>
The function should reject input that is not an integer or is out of range by redisplaying the whole menu before asking again for a number. The function should return an empty string if called with an empty list. 

For test purposes use the following four phrases in a list:
    fee fie
    huff and puff
    mirror mirror
    tick tock
