;Task:
Write a function/procedure/subroutine that is called with an integer value and returns the middle three digits of the integer if possible or a clear indication of an error if this is not possible.

Note: The order of the middle digits should be preserved.

Your function should be tested with the following values; the first line should return valid answers, those of the second line should return clear indications of an error:
<pre>
123, 12345, 1234567, 987654321, 10001, -10001, -123, -100, 100, -12345
1, 2, -1, -10, 2002, -2002, 0
</pre>
Show your output on this page.
