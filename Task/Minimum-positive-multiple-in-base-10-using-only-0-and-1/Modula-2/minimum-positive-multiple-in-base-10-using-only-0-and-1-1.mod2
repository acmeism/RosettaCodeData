DEFINITION MODULE B10AsBin;

(* Returns a number representing the B10 of the passed-in number N.
   The result has the same binary digits as B10 has decimal digits,
   e.g. N = 7 returns 9 = 1001 binary, representing 1001 decimal.
   Returns 0 if the procedure fails.
   In TopSpeed Modula-2, CARDINAL is unsigned 16-bit, LONGCARD is unsigned 32-bit.
