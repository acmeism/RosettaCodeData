Given a random number generator, (rng), generating numbers in the range 0.0 .. 1.0 called rgen, for example; and a function modifier(x)
taking an number in the same range and generating the probability that the input should be generated, in the same range 0..1; then implement the following algorithm for generating random numbers to the probability given by  function modifier:
<pre>while True:
    random1 = rgen()
    random2 = rgen()
    if random2 < modifier(random1):
        answer = random1
        break
    endif
endwhile</pre>

;Task:
* Create a modifier function that generates a 'V' shaped probability of number generation using something like, for example:
                       modifier(x)  =  2*(0.5 - x)  if x < 0.5  else 2*(x - 0.5) 
* Create a generator of random numbers with probabilities modified by the above function.
* Generate >= 10,000 random numbers subject to the probability modification.
* Output a textual histogram with from 11 to 21 bins showing the distribution of the random numbers generated.
