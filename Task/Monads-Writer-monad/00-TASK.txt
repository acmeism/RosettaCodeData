The Writer monad is a programming design pattern which makes it possible to compose functions which return their result values paired with a log string. The final result of a composed function yields both a value, and a concatenation of the logs from each component function application.

Demonstrate in your programming language the following:

# Construct a Writer monad by writing the 'bind' function and the 'unit' (sometimes known as 'return') function for that monad (or just use what the language already provides)
# Write three simple functions: root, addOne, and half
# Derive Writer monad versions of each of these functions
# Apply a composition of the Writer versions of root, addOne, and half to the integer 5, deriving both a value for the Golden Ratio Ï†, and a concatenated log of the function applications (starting with the initial value, and followed by the application of root, etc.)
