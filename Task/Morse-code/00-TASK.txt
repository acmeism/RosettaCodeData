[[wp:Morse_code|Morse code]] is one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication in existence. 
It has been in use for more than 175 years â€” longer than any other electronic encoding system.


;Task:
Send a string as audible Morse code to an audio device &nbsp; (e.g., the PC speaker).


As the standard Morse code does not contain all possible characters, 
you may either ignore unknown characters in the file, 
or indicate them somehow &nbsp; (e.g. with a different pitch).
