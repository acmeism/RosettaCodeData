;Task:
Output the 8 notes of the <b>C major</b> diatonic scale to the default musical sound device on the system. Specifically, pitch must be tuned to 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with the modern standard A=440Hz.

These are the notes "C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C(1 octave higher)", or "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si/Ti, Do(1 octave higher)" on <i>Fixed do Solf√®ge</i>.

For the purpose of this task, <b>Middle C</b> (in the case of the above tuning, around 261.63 Hz) should be used as the starting note, and any note duration is allowed.

For languages that cannot utilize a sound device, it is permissible to output to a musical score sheet (or midi file),  or the task can be omitted.
