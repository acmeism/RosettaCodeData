A [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NarcissisticNumber.html Narcissistic decimal number] is a non-negative integer, <math>n</math>, that is equal to the sum of the <math>m</math>-th powers of each of the digits in the decimal representation of <math>n</math>, where <math>m</math> is the number of digits in the decimal representation of <math>n</math>.

Narcissistic (decimal) numbers are sometimes called &nbsp; '''Armstrong''' &nbsp; numbers, named after Michael F. Armstrong.

For example, if <math>n</math> is 153 then <math>m</math>, the number of digits, is 3 and we have <math>1^3+5^3+3^3 = 1+125+27 = 153</math> and so 153 is a narcissistic decimal number.

The task is to generate and show here the first 25 narcissistic decimal numbers.

<small>Note: <math>0^1 = 0</math>, the first in the series.</small>
