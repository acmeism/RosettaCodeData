;Task

Write a small program that emulates a [[wp:Ship's bell#Timing_of_duty_periods|nautical bell]] producing a ringing bell pattern at certain times throughout the day.

The bell timing should be in accordance with [[wp:GMT|Greenwich Mean Time]], unless locale dictates otherwise.

It is permissible for the program to [[Run as a daemon or service|daemonize]], or to slave off a scheduler, and it is permissible to use alternative notification methods (such as producing a written notice "Two Bells Gone"), if these are more usual for the system type.
