Nim is a simple game where the second player─if they know the trick─will always win.


The game has only 3 rules:
::* &nbsp; start with &nbsp; '''12''' &nbsp; tokens
::* &nbsp; each player takes &nbsp;  '''1, &nbsp;2, &nbsp;or &nbsp;3''' &nbsp; tokens in turn
::* &nbsp;the player who takes the last token wins.


To win every time, &nbsp; the second player simply takes 4 minus the number the first player took. &nbsp; So if the first player takes 1, &nbsp; the second takes 3; if the first player takes 2, &nbsp; the second should take 2; and if the first player takes 3, &nbsp; the second player will take 1. 

;Task:
Design a simple Nim game where the human player goes first, and the computer always wins. The game should enforce the rules.
