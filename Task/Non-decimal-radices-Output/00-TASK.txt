Programming languages often have built-in routines to convert a non-negative integer for printing in different number bases. Such common number bases might include binary, [[Octal]] and [[Hexadecimal]].


;Task:
Print a small range of integers in some different bases, as supported by standard routines of your programming language. 


;Note:
This is distinct from [[Number base conversion]] as a user-defined conversion function is '''not''' asked for.)

The reverse operation is [[Common number base parsing]].
