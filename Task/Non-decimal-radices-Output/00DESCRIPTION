Programming languages often have built-in routines to convert a non-negative integer for printing in different number bases. Such common number bases might include binary, [[Octal]] and [[Hexadecimal]].

Show how to print a small range of integers in some different bases, as supported by standard routines of your programming language. (Note: this is distinct from [[Number base conversion]] as a user-defined conversion function is '''not''' asked for.)

The reverse operation is [[Common number base parsing]].
