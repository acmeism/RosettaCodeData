;Example
Consider the number 24. Its proper divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12. Their product is 13,824 and the cube root of this is 24. So 24 satisfies the definition in the task title.

;Task
Compute and show here the first '''50''' positive integers which are the cube roots of the product of their proper divisors.

Also show the '''500th''' and '''5,000th''' such numbers.

;Stretch
Compute and show the '''50,000th''' such number.

;Reference
* [[oeis:A111398|OEIS:A111398 - Numbers which are the cube roots of the product of their proper divisors.]]

;Note
OEIS considers 1 to be the first number in this sequence even though, strictly speaking, it has no proper divisors. Please therefore do likewise.
