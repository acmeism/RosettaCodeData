;Task:
Present a program which emits the lyrics to the song &nbsp; ''[[wp:There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly|I Knew an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]'', &nbsp; taking advantage of the repetitive structure of the song's lyrics.

This song has multiple versions with slightly different lyrics, so all these programs might not emit identical output.
