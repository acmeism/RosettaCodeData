{{Sorting Algorithm}}
[[Category:Sorting]]

Assume we have a set of items that can be sorted into an order by the user.

The user is presented with pairs of items from the set in ''no'' order,
the user states which item
is less than, equal to, or greater than the other (with respect to their
relative positions if fully ordered).

Write a function that given items that the user can order, '''asks the user''' to
give the result of ''comparing two items at a time'' and uses the comparison results
to eventually return the items in order. 

Try and minimise the comparisons the user is asked for.

Show on this page, the function ordering the colours of the rainbow:
    violet red green indigo blue yellow orange

The correct ordering being:
    red orange yellow green blue indigo violet

Note:
* Asking for/receiving user comparisons is a part of the task.
* Code ''inputs'' should not assume an ordering.
* The seven colours can form twenty-one different pairs.
* A routine that does not ask the user "too many" comparison questions should be used.
