The [[wp:Padovan sequence|Padovan sequence]] is similar to the [[wp:Fibonacci sequence|Fibonacci sequence]] in several ways.
Some are given in the table below, and the referenced video shows some of the geometric
similarities.

;Task:
* Write a function/method/subroutine to compute successive members of the Padovan series using the recurrence relation.
* Write a function/method/subroutine to compute successive members of the Padovan series using the floor function.
* Show the first twenty terms of the sequence.
* Confirm that the recurrence and floor based functions give the same results for 64 terms,
* Write a function/method/... using the [[wp:L-system|L-system]] to generate successive strings.
* Show the first 10 strings produced from the L-system
* Confirm that the length of the first 32 strings produced is the Padovan sequence.
