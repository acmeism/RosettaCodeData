Today &nbsp; ('''2020-02-02''', &nbsp; at the time of this writing) &nbsp; happens to be a palindrome, &nbsp; without the hyphens, &nbsp; not only for those countries which express their dates in the &nbsp; '''yyyy-mm-dd''' &nbsp; format but, &nbsp; unusually, &nbsp; also for countries which use the &nbsp; '''dd-mm-yyyy''' &nbsp; format.


;Task
Write a program which calculates and shows the next 15 palindromic dates for those countries which express their dates in the &nbsp; '''yyyy-mm-dd''' &nbsp; format.
