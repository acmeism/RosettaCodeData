Write at least one function/method (or whatever it is called in your
preferred language) to check if a sequence of characters (or bytes)
is a [[wp:Palindrome|palindrome]] or not.
The ''function'' must return a boolean value
(or something that can be used as boolean value, like an integer).

It is not mandatory to write also an example code that uses
the ''function'', unless its usage could be not clear
(e.g. the provided recursive C solution
needs explanation on how to call the function).

It is not mandatory to handle properly encodings (see [[String length]]),
i.e. it is admissible that the function does not recognize 'sal&agrave;las'
as palindrome.

The function must not ignore spaces and punctuations.
The compliance to the aforementioned, strict or not,
requirements completes the task.

'''Example'''<br>
An example of a Latin palindrome is the sentence
"''In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni''",
roughly translated as: we walk around in the night and we are burnt by the fire (of love).
To do your test with it, you must make it all the same case and strip spaces.

'''Clarification'''<br>
To remove some confusion expressed in the discussion tab:

* To satisfy this task, the function should only identify exact palindromes; it should *not* strip spaces or punctuation or convert case.
* You may additionally write a wrapper function to detect inexact palindromes, such as the Latin example in the task description, or simply do the conversion in the calling function of your test code.

'''Notes'''<br>
* It might be useful for this task to know how to [[Reversing a string|reverse a string]].
* This task's entries might also form the subjects of the task [[Test a function]].
