To decide if a string is palindromic:
Slap a substring on the string.
Loop.
If the substring's first is greater than the substring's last, say yes.
If the substring's first's target is not the substring's last's target, say no.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Subtract 1 from the substring's last.
Repeat.
