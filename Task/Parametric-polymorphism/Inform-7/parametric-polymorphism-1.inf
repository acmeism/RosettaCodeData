Polymorphism is a room.

To find (V - K) in (L - list of values of kind K):
	repeat with N running from 1 to the number of entries in L:
		if entry N in L is V:
			say "Found [V] at entry [N] in [L].";
			stop;
	say "Did not find [V] in [L]."

When play begins:
	find "needle" in {"parrot", "needle", "rutabaga"};
	find 6 in {2, 3, 4};
	end the story.
