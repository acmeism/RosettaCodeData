Create a stack-based evaluator for an expression in [[wp:Reverse Polish notation|reverse Polish notation]] that also shows the changes in the stack
as each individual token is processed ''as a table''.

* Assume an input of a correct, space separated, string of tokens of an RPN expression
* Test with the RPN expression generated from the [[Parsing/Shunting-yard algorithm]] task <code>'3 4 2 * 1 5 - 2 3 ^ ^ / +'</code> then print and display the output here.

;Note:
* '^' means exponentiation in the expression above.

;See also:
* [[Parsing/Shunting-yard algorithm]] for a method of generating an RPN from an infix expression.
* Several solutions to [[24 game/Solve]] make use of RPN evaluators (although tracing how they work is not a part of that task).
* [[Parsing/RPN to infix conversion]].
* [[Arithmetic evaluation]].
