[[wp:Partial application|Partial function application]] is the ability to take a function of many
parameters and apply arguments to some of the parameters to create a new
function that needs only the application of the remaining arguments to
produce the equivalent of applying all arguments to the original function.

E.g:
: Given values <code>v1, v2</code>
: Given <code>f(param1, param2)</code>
: Then  <code>partial(f, param1=v1)</code> returns <code>f'(param2)</code>
: And   <code>f(param1=v1, param2=v2) == f'(param2=v2)</code> (for any value v2)

Note that in the partial application of a parameter, (in the above case param1), other parameters are not explicitly mentioned. This is a recurring feature of partial function application.

;Task
* Create a function fs( f, s ) that takes a function, f( n ), of one value and a sequence of values s.<br> Function fs should return an ordered sequence of the result of applying function f to every value of s in turn.

* Create function f1 that takes a value and returns it multiplied by 2.
* Create function f2 that takes a value and returns it squared.

* Partially apply f1 to fs to form function fsf1( s )
* Partially apply f2 to fs to form function fsf2( s )

* Test fsf1 and fsf2 by evaluating them with s being the sequence of integers from 0 to 3 inclusive and then the sequence of even integers from 2 to 8 inclusive.

;Notes
* In partially applying the functions f1 or f2 to fs, there should be no ''explicit'' mention of any other parameters to fs, although introspection of fs within the partial applicator to find its parameters ''is'' allowed.
* This task is more about ''how'' results are generated rather than just getting results.
