Implement a particle fountain.

Emulate a fountain of water droplets in a gravitational field being sprayed up and then falling back down.

The particle fountain should be generally ordered but individually chaotic; the particles should be going mostly in the same direction, but should have slightly different vectors.

Your fountain should have at least several hundred particles in motion at any one time, and ideally several thousand.

It is optional to have the individual particle interact with each other.

If at all possible, link to a short video clip of your fountain in action.
