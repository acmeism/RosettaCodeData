[[wp:Pascal's triangle|Pascal's triangle]] is an arithmetic and geometric figure often associated with the name of [[wp:Blaise Pascal|Blaise Pascal]], but also studied centuries earlier in India, Persia, China and elsewhere.

Its first few rows look like this: <b>
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1 </b>
where each element of each row is either 1 or the sum of the two elements right above it. 

For example, the next row of the triangle would be:
::: &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; (since the first element of each row doesn't have two elements above it)
::: &nbsp; '''4''' &nbsp; (1 + 3)
::: &nbsp; '''6''' &nbsp; (3 + 3)
::: &nbsp; '''4''' &nbsp; (3 + 1)
::: &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; (since the last element of each row doesn't have two elements above it) 

So the triangle now looks like this: <b>
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1 </b>

Each row &nbsp; <tt> n </tt> &nbsp; (starting with row &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; at the top) shows the coefficients of the binomial expansion of &nbsp; <big><big> (x + y)<sup>n</sup>. </big></big>


;Task:
Write a function that prints out the first &nbsp; <tt> n </tt> &nbsp; rows of the triangle &nbsp; (with &nbsp; <tt> f(1) </tt> &nbsp; yielding the row consisting of only the element '''1'''). 

This can be done either by summing elements from the previous rows or using a binary coefficient or combination function. 

Behavior for &nbsp; <big><tt> n â‰¤ 0 </tt></big> &nbsp; does not need to be uniform, but should be noted.
