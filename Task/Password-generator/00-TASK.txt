Create a password generation program which will generate passwords containing random ASCII characters from the following groups:
          lower-case letters:  a ──► z
          upper-case letters:  A ──► Z
                      digits:  0 ──► 9
  other printable characters: <big><big> !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_{|}~ </big></big>
  (the above character list excludes white-space, backslash and grave) 


The generated password(s) must include &nbsp; ''at least one'' &nbsp; (of each of the four groups):
    lower-case letter, 
    upper-case letter,
    digit  (numeral), &nbsp; and 
    one  "other"  character. 

<br>
The user must be able to specify the password length and the number of passwords to generate. 

The passwords should be displayed or written to a file, one per line.

The randomness should be from a system source or library. 

The program should implement a help option or button which should describe the program and options when invoked. 

You may also allow the user to specify a seed value, and give the option of excluding visually similar characters.

For example: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <big><big> Il1 &nbsp; &nbsp; O0 &nbsp; &nbsp; 5S &nbsp; &nbsp; 2Z </big></big> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where the characters are: 
::::* &nbsp; capital eye, lowercase ell, the digit one
::::* &nbsp; capital oh, the digit zero 
::::* &nbsp; the digit five, capital ess
::::* &nbsp; the digit two, capital zee
<!-- or zed, on the other side of the pond. -->
