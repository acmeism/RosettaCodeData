[[wp:Penney's_game|Penney's game]] is a game where two players bet on being the first to see a particular sequence of [[wp:Coin_flipping|heads or tails]] in consecutive tosses of a [[wp:Fair_coin|fair coin]].

It is common to agree on a sequence length of three then one player will openly choose a sequence, for example:
  Heads,  Tails,  Heads, or '''HTH''' for short.
The other player on seeing the first players choice will choose his sequence. The coin is tossed and the first player to see his sequence in the sequence of coin tosses wins.


;Example:
One player might choose the sequence '''HHT''' and the other '''THT'''. 

Successive coin tosses of '''HTTHT''' gives the win to the second player as the last three coin tosses are his sequence.
