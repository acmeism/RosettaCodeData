The &nbsp; '''[[wp:Perlin noise|Perlin noise]]''' &nbsp; is a kind of &nbsp; [[wp:gradient noise|gradient noise]] &nbsp; invented by &nbsp; [[wp:Ken Perlin|Ken Perlin]] &nbsp; around the end of the twentieth century and still currently heavily used in &nbsp; [[wp:computer graphics|computer graphics]], &nbsp; most notably to procedurally generate textures or heightmaps. 

The Perlin noise is basically a &nbsp; [[random numbers|pseudo-random]] &nbsp; mapping of &nbsp; <big><big><math>\R^d</math></big></big> &nbsp; into &nbsp; <big><big><math>\R</math></big></big> &nbsp; with an integer &nbsp; <big><math>d</math></big> &nbsp; which can be arbitrarily large but which is usually &nbsp; 2, &nbsp; 3, &nbsp; or &nbsp; 4.

Either by using a dedicated library or by implementing the algorithm, show that the Perlin noise &nbsp; (as defined in 2002 in the Java implementation below) &nbsp; of the point in 3D-space with coordinates &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.14, &nbsp; 42, &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; is &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.13691995878400012.


''Note: this result assumes 64 bit IEEE-754 floating point calculations. If your language uses a different floating point representation, make a note of it and calculate the value accurate to 15 decimal places, or your languages accuracy threshold if it is less. Trailing zeros need not be displayed.''
