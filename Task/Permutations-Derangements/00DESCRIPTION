A [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Derangement.html derangement] is a permutation of the order of distinct items in which ''no item appears in its original place''.

For example, the only two derangements of the three items (0, 1, 2) are (1, 2, 0), and (2, 0, 1).

The number of derangements of ''n'' distinct items is known as the subfactorial of ''n'', sometimes written as !''n''.
There are various ways to [[wp:Derangement#Counting_derangements|calculate]] !''n''.

;Task
The task is to:
# Create a named function/method/subroutine/... to generate derangements of the integers ''0..n-1'', (or ''1..n'' if you prefer).
# Generate ''and show'' all the derangements of 4 integers using the above routine.
# Create a function that calculates the subfactorial of ''n'', !''n''.
# Print and show a table of the ''counted'' number of derangements of ''n'' vs. the calculated !''n'' for n from 0..9 inclusive.

As an optional stretch goal:
:* Calculate !''20''.
