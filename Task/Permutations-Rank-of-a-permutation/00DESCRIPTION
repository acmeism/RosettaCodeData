A particular ranking of a permutation associates an integer with a particular ordering of all the permutations of a set of distinct items.
For our purposes the ranking will assign integers <math>0 .. (n! - 1)</math> to an ordering of all the permutations of the integers <math>0 .. (n - 1)</math>.

For example, the permutations of the digits zero to 3 arranged lexicographically have the following rank:

<pre>  PERMUTATION      RANK
  (0, 1, 2, 3) ->  0
  (0, 1, 3, 2) ->  1
  (0, 2, 1, 3) ->  2
  (0, 2, 3, 1) ->  3
  (0, 3, 1, 2) ->  4
  (0, 3, 2, 1) ->  5
  (1, 0, 2, 3) ->  6
  (1, 0, 3, 2) ->  7
  (1, 2, 0, 3) ->  8
  (1, 2, 3, 0) ->  9
  (1, 3, 0, 2) -> 10
  (1, 3, 2, 0) -> 11
  (2, 0, 1, 3) -> 12
  (2, 0, 3, 1) -> 13
  (2, 1, 0, 3) -> 14
  (2, 1, 3, 0) -> 15
  (2, 3, 0, 1) -> 16
  (2, 3, 1, 0) -> 17
  (3, 0, 1, 2) -> 18
  (3, 0, 2, 1) -> 19
  (3, 1, 0, 2) -> 20
  (3, 1, 2, 0) -> 21
  (3, 2, 0, 1) -> 22
  (3, 2, 1, 0) -> 23</pre>

Algorithms exist that can generate a rank from a permutation for some particular ordering of permutations, and that can generate the same rank from the given individual permutation (i.e. given a rank of 17 produce (2, 3, 1, 0) in the example above).

One use of such algorithms could be in generating a small, random, sample of permutations of <math>n</math> items without duplicates when the total number of permutations is large. Remember that the total number of permutations of <math>n</math> items is given by <math>n!</math> which grows large very quickly: A 32 bit integer can only hold <math>12!</math>, a 64 bit integer only <math>20!</math>. It becomes difficult to take the straight-forward approach of generating all permutations then taking a random sample of them.

A [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12884428/generate-sample-of-1-000-000-random-permutations question on the Stack Overflow site] asked how to generate one million random and indivudual permutations of 144 items.
;This task is to:
# Create a function to generate a permutation from a rank.
# Create the inverse function that given the permutation generates its rank.
# Show that for <math>n=3</math> the two functions are indeed inverses of each other.
# Compute and show here 4 random, individual, samples of permutations of 12 objects.
;Stretch goal:
* State how reasonable it would be to use your program to address the limits of the Stack Overflow question.
