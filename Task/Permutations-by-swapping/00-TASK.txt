;Task:
Generate permutations of n items in which successive permutations differ from each other by the swapping of any two items. 

Also generate the sign of the permutation which is +1 when the permutation is generated from an even number of swaps from the initial state, and -1 for odd. 

Show the permutations and signs of three items, in order of generation ''here''.

Such data are of use in generating the [[Matrix arithmetic|determinant]] of a square matrix and any functions created should bear this in mind.

Note: The Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm generates successive permutations where ''adjacent'' items are swapped, but from [[wp:Parity_of_a_permutation#Example|this]] discussion adjacency is not a requirement.
