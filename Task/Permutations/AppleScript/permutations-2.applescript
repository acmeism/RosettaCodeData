--> Example 1 (list of words)
set [SourceList, PermList] to [{"Good", "Johnny", "Be"}, {}]
DoPermutations(SourceList, SourceList's length)
--> result (value of PermList)
{{"Good", "Johnny", "Be"}, {"Johnny", "Good", "Be"}, {"Be", "Good", "Johnny"}, Â¬
    {"Good", "Be", "Johnny"}, {"Johnny", "Be", "Good"}, {"Be", "Johnny", "Good"}}

--> Example 2 (characters with concatenated results)
set [SourceList, PermList] to [{"X", "Y", "Z"}, {}]
DoPermutations(SourceList, SourceList's length)
--> result (value of PermList)
{"XYZ", "YXZ", "ZXY", "XZY", "YZX", "ZYX"}

--> Example 3 (Integers)
set [SourceList, Permlist] to [{1, 2, 3}, {}]
DoPermutations(SourceList, SourceList's length)
--> result (value of Permlist)
{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 1, 3}, {3, 1, 2}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 2, 1}}

--> Example 4 (Integers with concatenated results)
set [SourceList, Permlist] to [{1, 2, 3}, {}]
DoPermutations(SourceList, SourceList's length)
--> result (value of Permlist)
{"123", "213", "312", "132", "231", "321"}
