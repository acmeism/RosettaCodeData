A &nbsp; [[wp:Pernicious number|pernicious number]] &nbsp; is a positive integer whose &nbsp; [[population count]] &nbsp; is a prime. 

The &nbsp; ''population count'' &nbsp; is the number of &nbsp; ''ones'' &nbsp; in the binary representation of a non-negative integer. 


;Example
'''22''' &nbsp; (which is &nbsp; '''10110''' &nbsp; in binary) &nbsp; has a population count of &nbsp; '''3''', &nbsp; which is prime, &nbsp; and therefore  
<br>'''22''' &nbsp; is a pernicious number.


;Task
* display the first &nbsp; '''25''' &nbsp; pernicious numbers &nbsp; (in decimal).
* display all pernicious numbers between &nbsp; '''888,888,877''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''888,888,888''' &nbsp; (inclusive).
* display each list of integers on one line &nbsp; (which may or may not include a title).
