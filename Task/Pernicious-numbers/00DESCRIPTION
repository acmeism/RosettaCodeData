A &nbsp; ''[[wp:Pernicious number|pernicious number]]'' &nbsp; is a positive integer whose &nbsp; [[population count]] &nbsp; is a prime.

The &nbsp; ''population count'' &nbsp; (also known as ''pop count'') &nbsp; is the number of <big>1</big>'s  &nbsp;(ones) in the binary representation of a non-negative integer.

For example: &nbsp; &nbsp; <big>22</big> &nbsp; (which is &nbsp; <big>10110</big> &nbsp; in binary) &nbsp; has a population count of &nbsp; <big>3</big> &nbsp; (which is prime), and therefore &nbsp; <big>22</big> &nbsp; is a pernicious number.
