The [[wp:Pig (dice)|game of Pig]] is a multiplayer game played with a single six-sided die. The
object of the game is to reach 100 points or more.
Play is taken in turns. On each person's turn that person has the option of either

# '''Rolling the dice''': where a roll of two to six is added to their score for that turn and the player's turn continues as the player is given the same choice again; or a roll of 1 loses the player's total points ''for that turn'' and their turn finishes with play passing to the next player.
# '''Holding''': The player's score for that round is added to their total and becomes safe from the effects of throwing a one. The player's turn finishes with play passing to the next player.
