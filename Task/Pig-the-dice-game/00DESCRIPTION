The &nbsp; [[wp:Pig (dice)|game of Pig]] &nbsp; is a multiplayer game played with a single six-sided die. &nbsp; The
object of the game is to reach &nbsp; '''100''' &nbsp; points or more. &nbsp;
Play is taken in turns. &nbsp; On each person's turn that person has the option of either:

:# '''Rolling the dice''': &nbsp; where a roll of two to six is added to their score for that turn and the player's turn continues as the player is given the same choice again; &nbsp; or a roll of &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; loses the player's total points &nbsp; ''for that turn'' &nbsp; and their turn finishes with play passing to the next player.
:# '''Holding''': &nbsp; the player's score for that round is added to their total and becomes safe from the effects of throwing a &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; (one). &nbsp; The player's turn finishes with play passing to the next player.
