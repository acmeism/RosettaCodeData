The task is to demonstrate the creation of a series of vertical pinstripes across '''the entire width of the display'''. 
* in the first quarter the pinstripes should alternate one pixel white, one pixel black =  1 pixel wide vertical pinestripes
* Quarter of the way down the display, we can switch to a wider 2 pixel wide vertical pinstripe pattern, alternating two pixels white, two pixels black. 
* Half way down the display, we switch to 3 pixels wide, 
* for the lower quarter of the display we use 4 pixels.
