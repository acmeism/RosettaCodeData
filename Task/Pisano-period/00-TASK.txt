The [[wp:Fibonacci_Number|Fibonacci sequence]] taken modulo 2 is a periodic sequence of period 3 : 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, ... 

For any integer n, the Fibonacci sequence taken modulo n is periodic and the length of the periodic cycle is referred to as the [[wp:Pisano_period|Pisano period]].

Prime numbers are straightforward; the Pisano period of a prime number '''p''' is simply: '''pisano(p)'''. The Pisano period of a composite number '''c''' may be found in different ways. It may be calculated directly: '''pisano(c)''', which works, but may be time consuming to find, especially for larger integers, or, it may be calculated by finding the [[wp:Least common multiple|least common multiple]] of the Pisano periods of each composite component. 


;E.G.:
Given a Pisano period function: pisano(x), and a least common multiple function lcm(x, y):
    <big>'''pisano(m Ã— n)''' is equivalent to '''lcm(pisano(m), pisano(n))''' where  '''m'''  and  '''n'''  are '''[[wp:Coprime|coprime]]'''</big>
A formulae to calculate the pisano period for integer powers &nbsp; '''k''' &nbsp; of prime numbers &nbsp; '''p''' &nbsp; is:
    <big>'''pisano(p<sup>k</sup>) == p<sup>(k-1)</sup>pisano(p)''' </big>
The equation is conjectured, no exceptions have been seen.

If a positive integer &nbsp; '''i''' &nbsp; is split into its prime factors, &nbsp; then the second and first equations above can be applied to generate the pisano period.


;Task
Write 2 functions: pisanoPrime(p,k) and pisano(m).

pisanoPrime(p,k) should return the Pisano period of p<sup>k</sup> where p is prime and k is a positive integer.

pisano(m) should use pisanoPrime to return the Pisano period of m where m is a positive integer.

Print pisanoPrime(p,2) for every prime lower than 15.

Print pisanoPrime(p,1) for every prime lower than 180.

Print pisano(m) for every integer from 1 to 180.
