Load at least two prerecorded sounds, and demonstrate as many of theseÂ features as you can:
* playing them individually and simultaneously
* stopping before the end of the sound
* looping (preferably glitch-free)
* setting the volume of each sound
* stereo or 3D positional mixing
* performing other actions when marked times in the sound arrive
Describe:
* The supported audio formats, briefly.
* Whether it is suitable for game sound effects (low-latency start, resource efficiency, supports many simultaneous sounds, etc.)
* Whether it is suitable for playing music (long duration <!-- Other attributes? -->).

[Note: If it seems to be a good idea, this task may be revised to specify a particular timeline rather than just 'demonstrate these features'.]

Where applicable, please categorize examples primarily by the audio facility used (library/API/program/platform) rather than the language if the language is incidental (e.g. "Mac OS X CoreAudio" or "mplayer" rather than "C" or "bash").
