Create a data structure and the associated methods to define and manipulate a deck of [[wp:Playing-cards#Anglo-American-French|playing cards]]. The deck should contain 52 unique cards. The methods must include the ability to make a new deck, shuffle (randomize) the deck, deal from the deck, and print the current contents of a deck. Each card must have a pip value and a suit value which constitute the unique value of the card.
