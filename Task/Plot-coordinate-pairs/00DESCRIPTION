;Task:
Plot a function represented as &nbsp; `x', &nbsp; `y' &nbsp; numerical arrays.

Post the resulting image for the following input arrays (taken from [[Time_a_function#Python|Python's Example section on ''Time a function'']]):
 x = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
 y = {2.7, 2.8, 31.4, 38.1, 58.0, 76.2, 100.5, 130.0, 149.3, 180.0};

This task is intended as a subtask for [[Measure relative performance of sorting algorithms implementations]].
