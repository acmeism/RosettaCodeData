Find an approximating polynomial of known degree for a given data. 

Example:
For input data:
 x = {0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,   7,   8,   9,   10};
 y = {1,  6,  17, 34, 57, 86, 121, 162, 209, 262, 321};
The approximating polynomial is:
 3 x<sup>2</sup> + 2 x + 1
Here, the polynomial's coefficients are (3, 2, 1).

This task is intended as a subtask for [[Measure relative performance of sorting algorithms implementations]].
