A [[set]] is a collection (container) of certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values. It corresponds with a finite set in mathematics. A set can be implemented as an associative array (partial mapping) in which the value of each key-value pair is ignored.

Given a set S, the [[wp:Power_set|power set]] (or powerset) of S, written P(S), or 2<sup>S</sup>, is the set of all subsets of S.<br>
'''Task : ''' By using a library or build-in set type, or defining a set type with necessary operations, write a function with a set S as input that yields a power set 2<sup>S</sup> of S.

For example, the power set of {1,2,3,4} is {{}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}, {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, {4}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {1,2,4}, {3,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4}}.
