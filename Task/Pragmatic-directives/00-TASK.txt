Pragmatic directives cause the language to operate in a specific manner, &nbsp; allowing support for operational variances within the program code &nbsp; (possibly by the loading of specific or alternative modules).


;Task:
List any pragmatic directives supported by the language, &nbsp; and demonstrate how to activate and deactivate the pragmatic directives and to describe or demonstrate the scope of effect that the pragmatic directives have within a program.
