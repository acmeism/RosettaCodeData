;Task:
Write a boolean function that tells whether a given integer is prime. 


Remember that &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; and all non-positive numbers are not prime.

Use trial division. 

Even numbers greater than &nbsp; '''2''' &nbsp; may be eliminated right away. 

A loop from &nbsp; '''3''' &nbsp; to &nbsp; '''&radic;{{overline|&nbsp;n&nbsp;}} &nbsp;''' will suffice, &nbsp; but other loops are allowed.
