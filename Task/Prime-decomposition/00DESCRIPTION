The prime decomposition of a number is defined as a list of prime numbers
which when all multiplied together, are equal to that number.


;Example:
  12 = 2 &times; 2 &times; 3,  so its prime decomposition is  {2, 2, 3}


;Task:
Write a function which returns an [[Arrays|array]] or [[Collections|collection]] which contains the prime decomposition of a given number &nbsp; <big><big><math>n</math></big></big> &nbsp; greater than &nbsp; '''1'''.

If your language does not have an isPrime-like function available,
you may assume that you have a function which determines
whether a number is prime (note its name before your code).

If you would like to test code from this task, you may use code from [[Primality by trial division|trial division]] or the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]].

Note: The program must not be limited by the word size of your computer or some other artificial limit; it should work for any number regardless of size (ignoring the physical limits of RAM etc).
