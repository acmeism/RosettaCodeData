The prime decomposition of a number is defined as a list of prime numbers
which when all multiplied together, are equal to that number.

Example: 12 = 2 &times; 2 &times; 3, so its prime decomposition is {2, 2, 3}

Write a function which returns an [[Arrays|array]] or [[Collections|collection]] which contains the prime decomposition of a given number, n, greater than 1.
If your language does not have an isPrime-like function available,
you may assume that you have a function which determines
whether a number is prime (note its name before your code).

If you would like to test code from this task, you may use code from [[Primality by trial division|trial division]] or the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]].

Note: The program must not be limited by the word size of your computer or some other artificial limit; it should work for any number regardless of size (ignoring the physical limits of RAM etc).
