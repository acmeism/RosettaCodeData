NAME
    heapq - Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).

DESCRIPTION
    Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
    all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
    non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
    property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

    Usage:

    heap = []            # creates an empty heap
    heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
    item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap
    item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
    heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time
    item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds
                                   # new item; the heap size is unchanged

    Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:

    - We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
      index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
      obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.

    - Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.

    These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list
    without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()
    maintains the heap invariant!

FUNCTIONS
    heapify(...)
        Transform list into a heap, in-place, in O(len(heap)) time.

    heappop(...)
        Pop the smallest item off the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.

    heappush(...)
        Push item onto heap, maintaining the heap invariant.

    heappushpop(...)
        Push item on the heap, then pop and return the smallest item
        from the heap. The combined action runs more efficiently than
        heappush() followed by a separate call to heappop().

    heapreplace(...)
        Pop and return the current smallest value, and add the new item.

        This is more efficient than heappop() followed by heappush(), and can be
        more appropriate when using a fixed-size heap.  Note that the value
        returned may be larger than item!  That constrains reasonable uses of
        this routine unless written as part of a conditional replacement:

            if item > heap[0]:
                item = heapreplace(heap, item)

    merge(*iterables)
        Merge multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output.

        Similar to sorted(itertools.chain(*iterables)) but returns a generator,
        does not pull the data into memory all at once, and assumes that each of
        the input streams is already sorted (smallest to largest).

        >>> list(merge([1,3,5,7], [0,2,4,8], [5,10,15,20], [], [25]))
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25]

    nlargest(n, iterable, key=None)
        Find the n largest elements in a dataset.

        Equivalent to:  sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=True)[:n]

    nsmallest(n, iterable, key=None)
        Find the n smallest elements in a dataset.

        Equivalent to:  sorted(iterable, key=key)[:n]
