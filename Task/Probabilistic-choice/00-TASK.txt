Given a mapping between items and their required probability of occurrence, generate a million items ''randomly'' subject to the given probabilities and compare the target probability of occurrence versus the generated values.

The total of all the probabilities should equal one. (Because floating point arithmetic is involved, this is subject to rounding errors). 

Use the following mapping to test your programs:<pre>
aleph   1/5.0
beth    1/6.0
gimel   1/7.0
daleth  1/8.0
he      1/9.0
waw     1/10.0
zayin   1/11.0
heth    1759/27720 # adjusted so that probabilities add to 1</pre>
