The task is to programmatically obtain the name used to invoke the program. (For example determine whether the user ran "python hello.py", or "python hellocaller.py", a program importing the code from "hello.py".)

Sometimes a [[multiline shebang]] is necessary in order to provide the script name to a language's internal ARGV.
