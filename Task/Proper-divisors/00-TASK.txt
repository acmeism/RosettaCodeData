The &nbsp; [http://planetmath.org/properdivisor proper divisors] &nbsp; of a positive integer '''N''' are those numbers, other than '''N''' itself, that divide '''N''' without remainder. 

For '''N''' > 1 they will always include 1, &nbsp; but for '''N''' == 1 there are no proper divisors.


;Examples:
The proper divisors of &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; are &nbsp; 1, 2, and 3. 
<br>The proper divisors of &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; are &nbsp; 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, and 50.


;Task:
# Create a routine to generate all the proper divisors of a number.
# use it to show the proper divisors of the numbers 1 to 10 inclusive.
# Find a number in the range 1 to 20,000 with the most proper divisors. Show the number and just the count of how many proper divisors it has.
