; The Method:
To generate a sequence of n-digit pseudorandom numbers, an n-digit starting value is created and squared, producing a 2n-digit number. If the result has fewer than 2n digits, leading zeroes are added to compensate. The middle n digits of the result would be the next number in the sequence and returned as the result. This process is then repeated to generate more numbers. 
; Pseudo code:

<pre>var seed = 675248
function random()
    var s = str(seed * seed) 'str: turn a number into string
    do while not len(s) = 12
        s = "0" + s          'add zeroes before the string
    end do
    seed = val(mid(s, 4, 6)) 'mid: string variable, start, length
                             'val: turn a string into number
    return seed
end function
</pre>
; Middle-square method use:
<pre>
for i = 1 to 5
    print random()
end for
</pre>
;Task:

* Generate a class/set of functions that generates pseudo-random
numbers (6 digits) as shown above.

* Show the first five integers generated with the seed 675248 as shown above.

* Show your output here, on this page.
