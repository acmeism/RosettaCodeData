[[File:Fifo.gif|frame|right|Illustration of FIFO behavior]]
Implement a FIFO queue. Elements are added at one side and popped from the other in the order of insertion.

Operations:
* push (aka ''enqueue'') - add element
* pop (aka ''dequeue'') - pop first element
* empty - return truth value when empty

Errors:
* handle the error of trying to pop from an empty queue (behavior depends on the language and platform)

See [[Queue/Usage]] for the built-in FIFO or queue of your language or standard library.
