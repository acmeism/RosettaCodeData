Pretty much every programming language has some form of quoting construct to allow embedding of data in a program, be it literal strings, numeric data or some combination thereof.

Show examples of the quoting constructs in your language. Explain where they would likely be used, what their primary use is, what limitations they have and why one might be preferred over another. Is one style [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/interpolate interpolating] and another not? Are there restrictions on the size of the quoted data? The type? The format?

This is intended to be open-ended and free form. If you find yourself writing more than a few thousand words of explanation, summarize and provide links to relevant documentation; but do provide at least a fairly comprehensive summary here, on this page, '''NOT''' just a link to [See the language docs].

Note: This is primarily for quoting constructs for data to be "embedded" in some way into a program. If there is some special format for external data, it may be mentioned but that isn't the focus of this task.
