Create a simple interactive game which incorporates the following features:

* room-based navigation in three integer dimensions (x,y,z)
* player inventory
* three types of item: sledge, gold and ladder
* a goal coordinate

Use of the sledge should be required to create a passage between rooms.  The ladder should be present in a room (but not held by the player), in order for the player to access the room above him.  The gold need not have a function.

This project is based on [http://web.archive.org/web/20080212201605/http://shortcircuit.us/muddy-kinda-like-a-mud-but-single-player/ this blog post] by [[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]], and the Perl version comes from there.
