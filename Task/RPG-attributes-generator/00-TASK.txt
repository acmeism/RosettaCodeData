'''RPG''' &nbsp; = &nbsp; <u>R</u>ole <u>P</u>laying <u>G</u>ame.



You're running a tabletop RPG, and your players are creating characters.

Each character has six core attributes: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma.

One way of generating values for these attributes is to roll four, 6-sided dice (d6) and sum the three highest rolls, discarding the lowest roll.

Some players like to assign values to their attributes in the order they're rolled.

To ensure generated characters don't put players at a disadvantage, the following requirements must be satisfied:

* The total of all character attributes must be at least 75.
* At least two of the attributes must be at least 15.
<p></p>
However, this can require a lot of manual dice rolling. A programatic solution would be much faster.


;Task:
Write a program that:
# Generates 4 random, whole values between 1 and 6.
# Saves the sum of the 3 largest values.
# Generates a total of 6 values this way.
# Displays the total, and all 6 values once finished.
<p></p>
* The order in which each value was generated must be preserved.
* The total of all 6 values must be at least 75.
* At least 2 of the values must be 15 or more.
<p></p>
