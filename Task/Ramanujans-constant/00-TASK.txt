Calculate Ramanujan's constant (as described on the [http://oeis.org/wiki/Ramanujan%27s_constant OEIS site]) with at least
32 digits of precision, by the method of your choice.  Optionally, if using the 𝑒**(π*√''x'') approach,
show that when evaluated with the last four [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heegner_number Heegner numbers]
the result is ''almost'' an integer.
