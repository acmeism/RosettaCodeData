A Latin square of size <code>n</code> is an arrangement of <code>n</code> symbols  in an <code>n-by-n</code> square in such a way that each row and column has each symbol appearing exactly once.<br>
For the purposes of this task, a random Latin square of size <code>n</code> is a Latin square constructed or generated by a probabilistic procedure such that the probability of any particular Latin square of size <code>n</code> being produced is non-zero.

;Example n=4 randomised Latin square:
<pre>0 2 3 1
2 1 0 3
3 0 1 2
1 3 2 0</pre>

;Task:
# Create a function/routine/procedure/method/... that given <code>n</code> generates a randomised Latin square of size <code>n</code>.
# Use the function to generate ''and show here'', two randomly generated squares of size 5.

;Note: 
Strict ''uniformity'' in the random generation is a hard problem and '''not''' a requirement of the task.
