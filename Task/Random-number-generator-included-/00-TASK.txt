The task is to:
: State the type of random number generator algorithm used in a language's built-in random number generator. If the language or its immediate libraries don't provide a random number generator, skip this task.
: If possible, give a link to a wider [[wp:List of random number generators|explanation]] of the algorithm used.

<small>Note: the task is ''not'' to create an RNG, but to report on the languages in-built RNG that would be the most likely RNG used.</small>

The main types of pseudo-random number generator ([[wp:PRNG|PRNG]]) that are in use are the [[linear congruential generator|Linear Congruential Generator]] ([[wp:Linear congruential generator|LCG]]), and the Generalized Feedback Shift Register ([[wp:Generalised_feedback_shift_register#Non-binary_Galois_LFSR|GFSR]]), (of which the [[wp:Mersenne twister|Mersenne twister]] generator is a subclass). The last main type is where the output of one of the previous ones (typically a Mersenne twister) is fed through a [[cryptographic hash function]] to maximize unpredictability of individual bits. 

Note that neither LCGs nor GFSRs should be used for the most demanding applications (cryptography) without additional steps.
