;Task:
Generate a collection filled with &nbsp; '''1000''' &nbsp; normally distributed random (or pseudo-random) numbers 
with a mean of &nbsp; '''1.0''' &nbsp; and a &nbsp; [[wp:Standard_deviation|standard deviation]] &nbsp; of &nbsp; '''0.5'''

Many libraries only generate uniformly distributed random numbers. If so, you may use [[wp:Normal_distribution#Generating_values_from_normal_distribution|one of these algorithms]].
