Counting the frequency at which something occurs is a common activity in measuring performance and managing resources. In this task, we assume that there is some job which we want to perform repeatedly, and we want to know how quickly these jobs are being performed.

Of interest is the code that performs the actual measurements. Any other code (such as job implementation or dispatching) that is required to demonstrate the rate tracking is helpful, but not the focus.

Multiple approaches are allowed (even preferable), so long as they can accomplish these goals:

* Run N seconds worth of jobs and/or Y jobs.
* Report at least three distinct times.

<br>Be aware of the precision and accuracy limitations of your timing mechanisms, and document them if you can.
