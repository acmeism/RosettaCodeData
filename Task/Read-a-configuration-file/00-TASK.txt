The task is to read a configuration file in standard configuration file format, 
and set variables accordingly. 

For this task, we have a configuration file as follows:

 # This is a configuration file in standard configuration file format
 #
 # Lines beginning with a hash or a semicolon are ignored by the application
 # program. Blank lines are also ignored by the application program.
 
 # This is the fullname parameter
 FULLNAME Foo Barber
 
 # This is a favourite fruit
 FAVOURITEFRUIT banana
 
 # This is a boolean that should be set
 NEEDSPEELING
 
 # This boolean is commented out
 ; SEEDSREMOVED
 
 # Configuration option names are not case sensitive, but configuration parameter
 # data is case sensitive and may be preserved by the application program.
 
 # An optional equals sign can be used to separate configuration parameter data
 # from the option name. This is dropped by the parser. 
 
 # A configuration option may take multiple parameters separated by commas.
 # Leading and trailing whitespace around parameter names and parameter data fields
 # are ignored by the application program.
 
 OTHERFAMILY Rhu Barber, Harry Barber


For the task we need to set four variables according to the configuration entries as follows:

*fullname = Foo Barber
*favouritefruit = banana
*needspeeling = true
*seedsremoved = false


We also have an option that contains multiple parameters. These may be stored in an array.

* otherfamily(1) = Rhu Barber
* otherfamily(2) = Harry Barber
