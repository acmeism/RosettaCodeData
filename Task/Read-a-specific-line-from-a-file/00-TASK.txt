Some languages have special semantics for obtaining a known line number from a file.


;Task:
Demonstrate how to obtain the contents of a specific line within a file. 

For the purpose of this task demonstrate how the contents of the seventh line of a file can be obtained, &nbsp; and store it in a variable or in memory &nbsp; (for potential future use within the program if the code were to become embedded). 

If the file does not contain seven lines, &nbsp; or the seventh line is empty, &nbsp; or too big to be retrieved, &nbsp; output an appropriate message. 

If no special semantics are available for obtaining the required line, &nbsp; it is permissible to read line by line. 

Note that empty lines are considered and should still be counted.

Also note that for functional languages or languages without variables or storage, &nbsp; it is permissible to output the extracted data to standard output.
