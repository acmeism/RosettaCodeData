(exp 1)     ; e (Euler's number)
pi          ; pi constant
(sqrt x)    ; square root: works for negative reals and complex
(log x)     ; natural logarithm: works for negative reals and complex
(log x 10)  ; logarithm base 10
(exp x)     ; exponential
(abs x)     ; absolute value: result exact if input exact: (abs -1/3) -> 1/3.
(floor x)   ; floor: restricted to real, two valued (second value gives residue)
(ceiling x) ; ceiling: restricted to real, two valued (second value gives residue)
(expt x y)  ; power
