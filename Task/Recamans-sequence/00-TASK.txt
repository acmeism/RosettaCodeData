The '''[[wp:Recam치n's sequence|Recam치n's sequence]]''' generates Natural numbers.

Starting from a(0)=0, the n'th term <code>a(n)</code>, where n>0, is the previous term minus <code>n</code> i.e <code>a(n) = a(n-1) - n</code> but only if this is '''both''' positive ''and'' has not been previousely generated.<br>

If the conditions ''don't'' hold then <code>a(n) = a(n-1) + n</code>.


;Task:
# Generate and show here the first 15 members of the sequence.
# Find and show here, the first duplicated number in the sequence.
# '''Optionally''': Find and show here, how many terms of the sequence are needed until all the integers 0..1000, inclusive, are generated.
