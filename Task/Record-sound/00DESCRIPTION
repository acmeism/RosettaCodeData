Record a monophonic 16-bit PCM sound into either memory space, a file or array.

(This task neglects to specify the sample rate, and whether to use signed samples.
The programs in this page might use signed 16-bit or unsigned 16-bit samples, at 8000 Hz, 44100 Hz, or any other sample rate.
Therefore, these programs might not record sound in the same format.)
