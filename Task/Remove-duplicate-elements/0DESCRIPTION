Given an Array, derive a sequence of elements in which all duplicates are removed.

There are basically three approaches seen here:
* Put the elements into a hash table which does not allow duplicates. The complexity is O(''n'') on average, and O(''n''<sup>2</sup>) worst case. This approach requires a hash function for your type (which is compatible with equality), either built-in to your language, or provided by the user.
* Sort the elements and remove consecutive duplicate elements. The complexity of the best sorting algorithms is O(''n'' log ''n''). This approach requires that your type be "comparable", i.e., have an ordering. Putting the elements into a self-balancing binary search tree is a special case of sorting.
* Go through the list, and for each element, check the rest of the list to see if it appears again, and discard it if it does. The complexity is O(''n''<sup>2</sup>). The up-shot is that this always works on any type (provided that you can test for equality).
