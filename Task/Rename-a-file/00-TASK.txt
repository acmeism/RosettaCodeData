;Task:
Rename:
:::* &nbsp; a file called &nbsp; &nbsp; '''input.txt''' &nbsp; &nbsp; into &nbsp; &nbsp; '''output.txt''' &nbsp; &nbsp; and 
:::* &nbsp; a directory called &nbsp; &nbsp; '''docs''' &nbsp; &nbsp; into &nbsp; &nbsp; '''mydocs'''.


This should be done twice: &nbsp; 
once "here", i.e. in the current working directory and once in the filesystem root.

It can be assumed that the user has the rights to do so.

(In unix-type systems, only the user root would have
sufficient permissions in the filesystem root.)
