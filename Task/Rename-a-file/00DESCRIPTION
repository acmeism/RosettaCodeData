In this task, the job is to rename the file called "input.txt" into "output.txt" and a directory called "docs" into "mydocs".

This should be done twice:
once "here", i.e. in the current working directory
and once in the filesystem root.

It can be assumed that the user has the rights to do so.
(In unix-type systems, only the user root would have
sufficient permissions in the filesystem root)
