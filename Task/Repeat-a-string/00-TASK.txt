Take a string and repeat it some number of times.  

Example: repeat("ha", 5) &nbsp; => &nbsp; "hahahahaha"

If there is a simpler/more efficient way to repeat a single “character” (i.e. creating a string filled with a certain character), you might want to show that as well (i.e. repeat-char("*", 5) => "*****").
