Demonstrate how to make the object respond (sensibly/usefully) to an invocation of a method on it that it does not support through its class definitions. Note that this is not the same as just invoking a defined method whose name is given dynamically; the method named at the point of invocation must not be defined.

This task is intended only for object systems that use a dynamic dispatch mechanism without static checking.
