;Task:
Create a function that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and returns its value as a numeric decimal integer. 

You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each decimal digit of the number to be encoded separately, 
<br>starting with the leftmost decimal digit and skipping any '''0'''s &nbsp; (zeroes). 

'''1990''' is rendered as &nbsp; '''MCMXC''' &nbsp; &nbsp; (1000 = M, &nbsp; 900 = CM, &nbsp; 90 = XC) &nbsp; &nbsp; and 
<br>'''2008''' is rendered as &nbsp; '''MMVIII''' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2000 = MM, &nbsp; 8 = VIII).
 
The Roman numeral for '''1666''', &nbsp; '''MDCLXVI''', &nbsp; uses each letter in descending order.
