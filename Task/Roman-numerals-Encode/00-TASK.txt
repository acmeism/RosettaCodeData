;Task:
Create a function taking a positive integer as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman numeral representation of that integer. Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately, starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. 


In Roman numerals:
* 1990  is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC
* 2008  is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII
* 1666  uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI
