;Task:
Given the name of a language on Rosetta Code, find all tasks which are not implemented in that language.


Note: Implementations should allow for fetching more data than can be returned in one request to Rosetta Code.

You'll need to use the Media Wiki API, which you can find out about locally, [http://rosettacode.org/mw/api.php here], or in Media Wiki's API documentation at, [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API_Query API:Query]
