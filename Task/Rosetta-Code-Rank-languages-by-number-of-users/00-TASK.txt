;Task:
Sort most popular programming languages based on the number of users on Rosetta Code. 

Show the languages with at least 100 users.


;A method to solve the task:
Users of a computer programming language &nbsp; '''X''' &nbsp; are those referenced in the page: 
  https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:X_User,     or preferably: 
  https://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Category:X_User&redirect=no to avoid re-directions. 

In order to find the list of such categories, &nbsp; it's possible to first parse the entries of: 
  http://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Special:Categories&limit=5000. 

Then download and parse each computer language &nbsp; ''users'' &nbsp; category to find the number of users of that computer language.

A Rosetta Code user usually declares using a language with the [[Template:Mylang|mylang]] template. This template is expected to appear on the User page. However, in some cases it appears in a user Talk page. It's not necessary to take this into account. For instance, among the 373 C users in the table above, 3 are actually declared in a Talk page.
