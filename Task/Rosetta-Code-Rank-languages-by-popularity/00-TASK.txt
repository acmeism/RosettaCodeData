;Notes: 
* &nbsp; Each language typically demonstrates one or two methods of accessing the data: 
:::* &nbsp; with web scraping &nbsp; (via http://www.rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Special:Categories&limit=5000)
:::* &nbsp; with the API method &nbsp; (examples below for [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#AWK|Awk]], [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#Perl|Perl]], [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#Ruby|Ruby]], [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#Tcl|Tcl]], etc). 
* &nbsp; The scraping and API solutions can be separate subsections, see the [[Rosetta Code/Rank languages by popularity#Tcl|Tcl example]].
* &nbsp; Filtering wrong results is optional. &nbsp; You can check against [[Special:MostLinkedCategories]] (if using web scraping)
::If you use the API, and do elect to filter, you may check your results against [[Rosetta_Code/Rank_languages_by_popularity/Full_list|this  complete, accurate, sortable, wikitable listing]] of all '''{{PAGESINCAT:Programming Languages}}''' [[:Category:Programming Languages|programming languages]], updated periodically, ''typically weekly''.
* &nbsp; A complete ranked listing of all &nbsp;                               '''813'''                            &nbsp; languages (from the REXX example) is included here &nbsp; ──► &nbsp; [[RC_POP.OUT|output from the REXX program]].
