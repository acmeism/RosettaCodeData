Implement a "rot-13" function (or procedure, class, subroutine,
or other "callable" object as appropriate to your programming environment).

Optionally wrap this function in a utility program (like [[:Category:Tr|tr]],
which acts like a common [[UNIX]] utility, performing a line-by-line rot-13 encoding
of every line of input contained in each file listed on its command line, or
(if no filenames are passed thereon) acting as a filter on its "standard input."

(A number of UNIX scripting languages and utilities, such as
''awk'' and ''sed'' either default to processing files in this way
or have command line switches or modules to easily implement
these wrapper semantics, e.g., [[Perl]] and [[Python]]).

The "rot-13" encoding is commonly known from the early days of
Usenet "Netnews" as a way of obfuscating text to prevent casual reading
of [[wp:Spoiler (media)|spoiler]] or potentially offensive material.

Many news reader and mail user agent programs have built-in "rot-13" encoder/decoders
or have the ability to feed a message through any external utility script for
performing this (or other) actions.

The definition of the rot-13 function is to simply replace every letter
of the ASCII alphabet with the letter which is "rotated" 13 characters
"around" the 26 letter alphabet from its normal cardinal position
(wrapping around from "z" to "a" as necessary).

Thus the letters "abc" become "nop" and so on.
Technically rot-13 is a "monoalphabetic substitution cipher"
with a trivial "key".

A proper implementation should work on upper and lower case letters,
preserve case, and pass all non-alphabetic characters
in the input stream through without alteration.
