; that should not be transformed, like numbers, spaces and symbols.

text: "This is a 28-character test!"

print "Using cipher table:"

; I build a set of correspondence lists here. 'x' is the letters from
; A-Z, in both upper and lowercase form. Note that REBOL can iterate
; directly over the alphabetic character sequence in the for loop. 'y'
; is the cipher form, 'x' rotated by 26 characters (remember, I have
; the lower and uppercase forms together). 'r' holds the final result,
; built as I iterate across the 'text' string. I search for the
; current character in the plaintext list ('x'), if I find it, I get
; the corresponding character from the ciphertext list
; ('y'). Otherwise, I pass the character through untransformed, then
; return the final string.

; Note that I am setting the 'text' variable to the result of rot-13

; I'm using REBOL's 'parse' word here. I set up character sets for
; upper and lower-case letters, then let parse walk across the
; text. It looks for matches to upper-case letters, then lower-case,
; then skips to the next one if it can't find either. If a matching
; character is found, it's mathematically incremented by 13 and
; clamped to the appropriate character range. parse changes the
; character in place in the string, hence this is a destructive
; operation.
