'''SHA-1''' or '''SHA1''' is a one-way hash function;
it computes a 160-bit message digest.
SHA-1 often appears in security protocols; for example,
many HTTPS websites use RSA with SHA-1 to secure their connections.
BitTorrent uses SHA-1 to verify downloads.
Git and Mercurial use SHA-1 digests to identify commits.

A US government standard, [[SHA-1/FIPS-180-1|FIPS 180-1]], defines SHA-1.

Find the SHA-1 message digest for a string of [[octet]]s. You may either call a SHA-1 library, or implement SHA-1 in your language. Both approaches interest Rosetta Code.
