Implementation of [[wp:Interval_arithmetic|interval arithmetic]] and more generally fuzzy number arithmetic require operations that yield safe upper and lower bounds of the exact result. For example, for an addition, it is the operations +&uarr; and +&darr; defined as: ''a'' +&darr; ''b'' &le; ''a'' + ''b'' &le; ''a'' +&uarr; ''b''. Additionally it is desired that the width of the interval (''a'' +&uarr; ''b'') - (''a'' +&darr; ''b'') would be about the machine epsilon after removing the exponent part.

Differently to the standard floating-point arithmetic, safe interval arithmetic is '''accurate''' (but still imprecise). I.e. the result of each defined operation contains (though does not identify) the exact mathematical outcome.

Usually a [[wp:Floating_Point_Unit|FPU's]] have machine +,-,*,/ operations accurate within the machine precision. To illustrate it, let us consider a machine with decimal floating-point arithmetic that has the precision is 3 decimal points. If the result of the machine addition is 1.23, then the exact mathematical result is within the interval ]1.22, 1.24[. When the machine rounds towards zero, then the exact result is within [1.23,1.24[. This is the basis for an implementation of safe addition.

===Task===
Show how +&darr; and +&uarr; can be implemented in your language using the standard floating-point type. Define an interval type based on the standard floating-point one, and implement an interval-valued addition of two floating-point numbers considering them exact, in short an operation that yields the interval [''a'' +&darr; ''b'', ''a'' +&uarr; ''b''].
