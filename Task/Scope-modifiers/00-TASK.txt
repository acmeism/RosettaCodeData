Most programming languages offer support for [[Creating a function|subroutines]]. 
When execution changes between subroutines, different sets of variables and functions ("scopes") are available to the program. 
Frequently these sets are defined by the placement of the variable and function declarations ("static scoping" or "lexical scoping"). 
These sets may also be defined by special modifiers to the variable and function declarations.

Show the different scope modifiers available in your language and briefly explain how they change the scope of their variable or function. 
If your language has no scope modifiers, note it.
