;Task
This is admittedly a trivial task but I thought it would be interesting to see how succinctly (or otherwise) different languages can handle it.

Given the string: "abracadabra", replace programatically:

* the first 'a' with 'A'
* the second 'a' with 'B'
* the fourth 'a' with 'C'
* the fifth 'a' with 'D'
* the first 'b' with 'E'
* the second 'r' with 'F'
<br>
Note that there is no replacement for the third 'a', second 'b' or first 'r'.

The answer should, of course, be : "AErBcadCbFD".
