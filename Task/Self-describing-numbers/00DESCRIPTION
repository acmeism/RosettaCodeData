There are several so-called "self-describing" or "[[wp:Self-descriptive number|self-descriptive]]" integers.

An integer is said to be "self-describing" if it has the property that, when digit positions are labeled 0 to N-1, the digit in each position is equal to the number of times that that digit appears in the number.

For example, 2020 is a four-digit self describing number:

* position 0 has value 2 and there are two 0s in the number;
* position 1 has value 0 and there are no 1s in the number;
* position 2 has value 2 and there are two 2s;
* position 3 has value 0 and there are zero 3s.

Self-describing numbers < 100.000.000: 1210, 2020, 21200, 3211000, 42101000.

;Task Description
# Write a function/routine/method/... that will check whether a given positive integer is self-describing.
# As an optional stretch goal - generate and display the set of self-describing numbers.
