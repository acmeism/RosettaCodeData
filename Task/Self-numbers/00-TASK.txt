A number n is a self number if there is no number g such that g + the sum of g's digits = n. So 18 is not a self number because 9+9=18, 43 is not a self number because 35+5+3=43.

The task is:
  Display the first 50 self numbers;
  I believe that the 100000000th self number is 1022727208. You should either confirm or dispute my conjecture.

2<sup>24036583</sup>-1 is a Mersenne prime, claimed to also be a self number. Extra credit to anyone proving it.<BR>
