The sequence of primorial primes is given as the increasing values of n where [[Primorial numbers|primorial]](n) Â± 1 is prime.

Noting that the n'th primorial is defined as the multiplication of the smallest n primes, the sequence is of the number of primes, in order that when multiplied together is one-off being a prime number itself.


;Task:
Generate and show here the first ten values of the sequence. 


;Optional extended task:
Show the first twenty members of the series.


;Notes: 
* This task asks for the primorial ''indices'' that create the final primorial prime numbers, so there should be no ten-or-more digit numbers in the program output (although extended precision integers ''will'' be needed for intermediate results).
* There is some confusion in the references, but for the purposes of this task the '''[[wp:Primorial prime|sequence]] begins with n = 1'''.
* Probabilistic primality tests are allowed, as long as they are good enough such that the output shown is correct.
