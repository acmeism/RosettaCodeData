Set Puzzles are created with a deck of cards from the [[wp:Set (game)|Set Gameâ„¢]]. The object of the puzzle is to find sets of 3 cards in a rectangle of cards that have been dealt face up. <br><br>
There are 81 cards in a deck. 
Each card contains a unique variation of the following four features: ''color, symbol, number and shading''.

* there are three colors:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''red, green, purple''<br><br>

* there are three symbols:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''oval, squiggle, diamond''<br><br>

* there is a number of symbols on the card:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''one, two, three''<br><br>

* there are three shadings:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''solid, open, striped''<br><br>

Three cards form a ''set'' if each feature is either the same on each card, or is different on each card. For instance: all 3 cards are red, all 3 cards have a different symbol, all 3 cards have a different number of symbols, all 3 cards are striped.

There are two degrees of difficulty: [http://www.setgame.com/set/rules_basic.htm ''basic''] and [http://www.setgame.com/set/rules_advanced.htm ''advanced'']. The basic mode deals 9 cards, that contain exactly 4 sets; the advanced mode deals 12 cards that contain exactly 6 sets. 

When creating sets you may use the same card more than once.
<br><br>

;Task
Write code that deals the cards (9 or 12, depending on selected mode) from a shuffled deck in which the total number of sets that could be found is 4 (or 6, respectively); and print the contents of the cards and the sets.
