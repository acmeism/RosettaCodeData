;Task: 
Choose popular date libraries used by your language and show the &nbsp; [[wp:Epoch_(reference_date)#Computing|epoch]] &nbsp; those libraries use. 

A demonstration is preferable &nbsp; (e.g. setting the internal representation of the date to 0 ms/ns/etc., &nbsp; or another way that will still show the epoch even if it is changed behind the scenes by the implementers), &nbsp; but text from (with links to) documentation is also acceptable where a demonstration is impossible/impractical. 

For consistency's sake, show the date in UTC time where possible.
