Choose popular date libraries used by your language and show the [[wp:Epoch_(reference_date)#Computing|epoch]] those libraries use. A demonstration is preferable (e.g. setting the internal representation of the date to 0 ms/ns/etc., or another way that will still show the epoch even if it is changed behind the scenes by the implementers), but text from (with links to) documentation is also acceptable where a demonstration is impossible/impractical. For consistency's sake, show the date in UTC time where possible.
