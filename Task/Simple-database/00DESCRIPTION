;Task:
Write a simple tool to track a small set of data.

The tool should have a command-line interface to enter at least two different values.

The entered data should be stored in a structured format and saved to disk.

It does not matter what kind of data is being tracked. &nbsp; It could be a collection (CDs, coins, baseball cards, books), a diary, an electronic organizer (birthdays/anniversaries/phone numbers/addresses), etc.


You should track the following details:
* A description of the item. (e.g., title, name)
* A category or tag (genre, topic, relationship such as “friend” or “family”)
* A date (either the date when the entry was made or some other date that is meaningful, like the birthday); the date may be generated or entered manually
* Other optional fields

<br>
The command should support the following [[Command-line arguments]] to run:
* Add a new entry
* Print the latest entry
* Print the latest entry for each category
* Print all entries sorted by a date

<br>
The category may be realized as a tag or as structure (by making all entries in that category subitems)

The file format on disk should be human readable, but it need not be standardized. &nbsp; A natively available format that doesn't need an external library is preferred. &nbsp; Avoid developing your own format if you can use an already existing one. &nbsp; If there is no existing format available, pick one of:
:::* &nbsp; [[JSON]]
:::* &nbsp; [[S-Expressions]]
:::* &nbsp; [[YAML]]
:::* &nbsp; [[wp:Comparison_of_data_serialization_formats|others]]
