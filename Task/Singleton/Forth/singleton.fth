\ A singleton is created by using normal Forth data
\ allocation words such as value or variable as instance variables.
\ Any number of instances of a singleton class may be
\ instantiated but messages will all operate on the same shared data
\ so it is the same as if only one object has been created.
\ The data name space will remain private to the class.
