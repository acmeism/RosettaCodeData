;Background on the task
In [[wp:Decision theory|decision theory]], [[wp:Sleeping Beauty problem|The Sleeping Beauty Problem]] 
is a problem invented by Arnold Zoboff and first publicized on Usenet. The experimental 
subject, named Sleeping Beauty, agrees to an experiment as follows:  
Sleeping Beauty volunteers to be put into a deep sleep on a Sunday. There is then a fair coin toss. 
If this coin toss comes up heads, Sleeping Beauty wakes once (on Monday) and is asked to 
estimate the probability that the coin toss was heads. Her estimate is recorded and she is 
then put back to sleep for 2 days until Wednesday, at which time the experiment's results are tallied.
<br />

If instead the coin toss is tails, Sleeping Beauty wakes as before on Monday and asked to 
estimate the probability the coin toss was heads, but is then given a drug which makes her forget 
that she had been woken on Monday before being put back to sleep again. She then wakes only 1 day 
later, on Tuesday. She is then asked (on Tuesday) again to guess the probability that the coin toss 
was heads or tails. She is then put back to sleep and awakes as before 1 day later, on Wednesday. 
<br />

Some decision makers have argued that since the coin toss was fair Sleeping Beauty should always 
estimate the probability of heads as 1/2, since she does not have any additional information. Others 
have disagreed, saying that if Sleeping Beauty knows the study design she also knows that she is twice 
as likely to wake up and be asked to estimate the coin flip on tails than on heads, so the estimate 
should be 1/3 heads.

;Task

Given the above problem, create a Monte Carlo estimate of the actual results. The program should find the 
proportion of heads on waking and asking Sleeping Beauty for an estimate, as a credence or as a percentage of the times Sleeping Beauty 
is asked the question.
