Generate the sequence of numbers '''a(k)''', where each '''k''' is the smallest positive integer such that '''k + 2<sup>m</sup>''' is composite for every positive integer '''m''' less than '''k'''.


;For example

Suppose k == 7; test m == 1 through m == 6. If any are prime, the test fails. 

Is 7 + 2<sup>1</sup> (9) prime? False

Is 7 + 2<sup>2</sup> (11) prime? True

So 7 is not an element of this sequence.

It is only necessary to test odd natural numbers k. An even number, plus any positive integer power of 2 is always composite.


;Task 

Find and display, here on this page, the first '''5''' elements of this sequence.
