The Smarandache prime-digital sequence (SPDS for brevity) is the sequence of primes whose digits are themselves prime.

For example 257 is an element of this sequence because it is prime itself and its digits: 2, 5 and 7 are also prime.

;Task
* Show the first 25 SPDS primes.
* Show the hundredth SPDS prime.
