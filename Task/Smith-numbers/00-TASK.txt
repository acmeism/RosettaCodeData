[[wp:Smith numbers|Smith numbers]] are numbers such that the [[Sum_digits_of_an_integer|sum of the decimal digits of the integers]] that make up that number is the same as the sum of the decimal digits of its prime factors excluding 1. 

By definition, all primes are ''excluded'' as they (naturally) satisfy this condition!

Smith numbers are also known as &nbsp; ''joke'' &nbsp; numbers.


;Example
Using the number '''166'''<br>
Find the prime factors of '''166''' which are: '''2''' x '''83'''<br>
Then, take those two prime factors and sum all their decimal digits: '''2 + 8 + 3''' which is '''13'''<br>
Then, take the decimal digits of '''166''' and add their decimal digits: '''1 + 6 + 6''' which is '''13'''<br>
Therefore, the number '''166''' is a Smith number.


;Task
Write a program to find all Smith numbers ''below'' 10000.
