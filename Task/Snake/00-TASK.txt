[[wp:Snake_(video_game)|Snake]] is a game where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length every time the snake reaches a food source.


;Task
Implement a variant of the Snake game, in any interactive environment, in which a sole player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. 

Each item eaten makes the snake longer and a new item is randomly generated somewhere else on the plane. 

The game ends when the snake attempts to eat himself.
