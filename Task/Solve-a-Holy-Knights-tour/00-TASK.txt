Chess coaches have been known to inflict a kind of torture on beginners by taking a chess board, placing pennies on some squares and requiring that a Knight's tour be constructed that avoids the squares with pennies. 

This kind of knight's tour puzzle is similar to &nbsp; [[Solve a Hidato puzzle|Hidato]].

The present task is to produce a solution to such problems. At least demonstrate your program by solving the following:


;Example:
<pre>
  0 0 0 
  0   0 0 
  0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0     0   0
0   0     0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0   0
      0 0 0
</pre>

Note that the zeros represent the available squares, not the pennies.

Extra credit is available for other interesting examples.
