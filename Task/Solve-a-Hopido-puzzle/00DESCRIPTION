Hopido puzzles are similar to [[Solve a Hidato puzzle | Hidato]]. The most important difference is that the only moves allowed are:  hop over one tile diagonally; and over two tiles horizontally and vertically. It should be possible to start anywhere in the path, the end point isn't indicated and there are no intermediate clues. [http://gamesandinnovation.com/2010/02/10/hopido-design-post-mortem/ Hopido Design Post Mortem] contains the following:

"Big puzzles represented another problem. Up until quite late in the project our puzzle solver was painfully slow with most puzzles above 7×7 tiles. Testing the solution from each starting point could take hours. If the tile layout was changed even a little, the whole puzzle had to be tested again. We were just about to give up the biggest puzzles entirely when our programmer suddenly came up with a magical algorithm that cut the testing process down to only minutes. Hooray!"

Knowing the kindness in the heart of every contributor to Rosetta Code, I know that we shall feel that as an act of humanity we must solve these puzzles for them in let's say milliseconds.

Example:

 . 0 0 . 0 0 .
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 . 0 0 0 0 0 .
 . . 0 0 0 . .
 . . . 0 . . .
