{{Sorting Algorithm}}
[[Category:Sorting]]

Sort an array of composite structures by a key. 


For example, if you define a composite structure that presents a name-value pair (in pseudo-code):

 Define structure pair such that: 
    name as a string
    value as a string

and an array of such pairs:

    x: array of pairs

then define a sort routine that sorts the array ''x'' by the key ''name''.

This task can always be accomplished with [[Sorting Using a Custom Comparator]].
