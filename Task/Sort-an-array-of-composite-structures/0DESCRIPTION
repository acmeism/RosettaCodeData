Sort an array of composite structures by a key. For example, if you define a composite structure that presents a name-value pair (in pseudocode):

 Define structure pair such that:
    name as a string
    value as a string

and an array of such pairs:

 x: array of pairs

then define a sort routine that sorts the array ''x'' by the key ''name''.

This task can always be accomplished with [[Sorting Using a Custom Comparator]]. If your language is not listed here, please see the other article.
