{{Sorting Algorithm}}

;Task:
Sort &nbsp; (the values of) &nbsp; three variables &nbsp; ('''X''', &nbsp; '''Y''', &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''Z''') &nbsp; that contain any value &nbsp; (numbers and/or literals).

If that isn't possible in your language, then just sort numbers &nbsp; (and note if they can be floating point, integer, or other).

I.E.:  &nbsp;  (for the three variables &nbsp; '''x''', &nbsp; '''y''', &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''z'''), &nbsp; where:
                         x =  'lions, tigers, and'
                         y =  'bears, oh my!'
                         z =  '(from the "Wizard of OZ")'

After sorting,  the three variables would hold:
                         x =  '(from the "Wizard of OZ")'
                         y =  'bears, oh my!'
                         z =  'lions, tigers, and'

<!--  Care was taken to use a leading lowercase letter so that EBCDIC and ASCII machines sort the literals in the same order. {Gerard Schildberger}  !-->
For numeric value sorting, use:
I.E.:  &nbsp;  (for the three variables &nbsp; '''x''', &nbsp; '''y''', &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''z'''), &nbsp; where:
                         x =  77444
                         y =    -12
                         z =      0
After sorting,  the three variables would hold:
                         x =    -12
                         y =      0
                         z =  77444

The variables should contain some form of a number, but specify if the algorithm
used can be for floating point or integers. &nbsp; Note any limitations.

The values may or may not be unique.

The method used for sorting can be any algorithm; &nbsp; the goal is to use the most idiomatic in the computer programming language used.

More than one algorithm could be shown if one isn't clearly the better choice.


One algorithm could be:
                         <big><big>&bull;</big></big>  store the three variables &nbsp; '''x''', '''y''', and '''z'''
                                  into an array (or a list) &nbsp; '''A'''
                         &nbsp;
                         <big><big>&bull;</big></big>  sort  (the three elements of)  the array &nbsp; '''A'''
                         &nbsp;
                         <big><big>&bull;</big></big>  extract the three elements from the array and place them in the
                                  variables '''x''', '''y''', and '''z''' &nbsp; in order of extraction



Another algorithm &nbsp; (only for numeric values):
        x= 77444 
        y=   -12 
        z=     0      
     low= x                                          
     mid= y                                          
    high= z 
       x= min(low,  mid,  high)            /*determine the lowest value of X,Y,Z. */    
       z= max(low,  mid,  high)            /*    "      "  highest  "    " " " "  */    
       y=     low + mid + high - x - z     /*    "      "  middle   "    " " " "  */
