{{Sorting Algorithm}}

;Task:
Sort an array of positive integers using the [[wp:Bead_sort|Bead Sort Algorithm]].


Algorithm has &nbsp; O(S), &nbsp; where &nbsp; S &nbsp; is the sum of the integers in the input set: &nbsp; Each bead is moved individually.

This is the case when bead sort is implemented without a mechanism to assist in finding empty spaces below the beads, such as in software implementations.
