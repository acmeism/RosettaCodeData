{{Sorting Algorithm}}
In this task, the goal is to sort an array of positive integers using the [[wp:Bead_sort|Bead Sort Algorithm]].

Algorithm has O(S), where S is the sum of the integers in the input set: Each bead is moved individually.
This is the case when bead sort is implemented without a mechanism to assist in finding empty spaces below the beads, such as in software implementations.
