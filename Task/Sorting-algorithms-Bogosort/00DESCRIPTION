{{Sorting Algorithm}}
[[wp:Bogosort|Bogosort]] a list of numbers.
Bogosort simply shuffles a collection randomly until it is sorted.

"Bogosort" is a perversely inefficient algorithm only used as an in-joke.
Its average run-time is O(n!) because the chance that any given shuffle of a set will end up in sorted order is about one in ''n'' factorial, and the worst case is infinite since there's no guarantee that a random shuffling will ever produce a sorted sequence. Its best case is O(n) since a single pass through the elements may suffice to order them.

Pseudocode:
 '''while not''' InOrder(list) '''do'''
    Shuffle(list)
 '''done'''

The [[Knuth shuffle]] may be used to implement the shuffle part of this algorithm.
