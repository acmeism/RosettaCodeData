{{Sorting Algorithm}}

;Task:
[[wp:Bogosort|Bogosort]] a list of numbers.


Bogosort simply shuffles a collection randomly until it is sorted.

"Bogosort" is a perversely inefficient algorithm only used as an in-joke.

Its average run-time is &nbsp; O(n!) &nbsp; because the chance that any given shuffle of a set will end up in sorted order is about one in &nbsp; ''n'' &nbsp; factorial, &nbsp; and the worst case is infinite since there's no guarantee that a random shuffling will ever produce a sorted sequence.

Its best case is &nbsp; O(n) &nbsp; since a single pass through the elements may suffice to order them.


Pseudocode:
 '''while not''' InOrder(list) '''do'''
    Shuffle(list)
 '''done'''

The [[Knuth shuffle]] may be used to implement the shuffle part of this algorithm.
