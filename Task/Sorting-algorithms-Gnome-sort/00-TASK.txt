Gnome sort is a sorting algorithm which is similar to [[Insertion sort]], except that moving an element to its proper place is accomplished by a series of swaps, as in [[Bubble Sort]].

The pseudocode for the algorithm is:
 '''function''' ''gnomeSort''(a[0..size-1])
     i := 1
     j := 2
     '''while''' i < size '''do'''
         '''if''' a[i-1] <= a[i] '''then'''
             ''// for descending sort, use >= for comparison''
             i := j
             j := j + 1 
         '''else'''
             '''swap''' a[i-1] '''and''' a[i]
             i := i - 1
             '''if''' i = 0 '''then'''
                 i := j
                 j := j + 1
             '''endif'''
         '''endif'''
     '''done'''


;Task:
Implement the Gnome sort in your language to sort an array (or list) of numbers.
