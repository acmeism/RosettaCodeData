Soundex is an algorithm for creating indices for words based on their pronunciation.


;Task:
The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling (from [[wp:soundex|the WP article]]).

;Caution:
There is a major issue in many of the implementations concerning the separation of two consonants that have the same soundex code! According to the official Rules [[https://www.archives.gov/research/census/soundex.html]]. So check for instance if '''Ashcraft'''  is coded to '''A-261'''.
* If a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) separates two consonants that have the same soundex code, the consonant to the right of the vowel is coded. Tymczak is coded as T-522 (T, 5 for the M, 2 for the C, Z ignored (see "Side-by-Side" rule above), 2 for the K). Since the vowel "A" separates the Z and K, the K is coded.
* If "H" or "W" separate two consonants that have the same soundex code, the consonant to the right of the vowel is not coded. Example: Ashcraft is coded A-261 (A, 2 for the S, C ignored, 6 for the R, 1 for the F). It is not coded A-226.
