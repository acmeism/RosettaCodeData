A [[wp:Sparkline|sparkline]] is a graph of successive values laid out horizontally
where the height of the line is proportional to the values in succession.


;Task:
Use the following series of Unicode characters to create a program
that takes a series of numbers separated by one or more whitespace or comma characters
and generates a sparkline-type bar graph of the values on a single line of output.

The eight characters: <code>'▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█'</code><br>
(Unicode values U+2581 through U+2588).

Use your program to show sparklines for the following input,
here on this page:
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
# 1.5, 0.5 3.5, 2.5 5.5, 4.5 7.5, 6.5
:(note the mix of separators in this second case)!

;Notes:
* A space is not part of the generated sparkline.
* The sparkline may be accompanied by simple statistics of the data such as its range.
* A suggestion emerging in later discussion (see [[Talk:Sparkline_in_unicode|Discussion]] page) is that the bounds between bins should ideally be set to yield the following results for two particular edge cases:

:: <code>"0, 1, 19, 20" -> ▁▁██</code>
:: (Aiming to use just two spark levels)

:: <code>"0, 999, 4000, 4999, 7000, 7999" -> ▁▁▅▅██</code>
:: (Aiming to use just three spark levels)

:: It may be helpful to include these cases in output tests.
* You may find that the unicode sparklines on this page are rendered less noisily by Google Chrome than by Firefox or Safari.
