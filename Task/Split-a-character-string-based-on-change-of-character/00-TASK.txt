;Task:
Split a (character) string into comma (plus a blank) delimited
strings based on a change of character &nbsp; (left to right).

Show the output here &nbsp; (use the 1<sup>st</sup> example below).


Blanks should be treated as any other character &nbsp; (except
they are problematic to display clearly). &nbsp; The same applies
to commas.


For instance, the string: 
 <big><big> gHHH5YY++///\ </big></big>
should be split and show:  
 <big><big> g, HHH, 5, YY, ++, ///, \ </big></big>
