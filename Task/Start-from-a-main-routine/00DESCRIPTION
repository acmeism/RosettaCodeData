{{omit from|BBC BASIC}}

Some languages (like Gambas and Visual Basic) support two startup modes. &nbsp; Applications written in these languages start with an open window that waits for events, and it is necessary to do some trickery to cause a main procedure to run instead. &nbsp; Data driven or event driven languages may also require similar trickery to force a startup procedure to run.


;Task:
Demonstrate the steps involved in causing the application to run a main procedure, rather than an event driven window at startup.

Languages that always run from main() can be omitted from this task.
