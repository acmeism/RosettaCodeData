'''Background'''

This task is inspired by [http://drdobbs.com/windows/198701685 Mark Nelson's DDJ Column "Wordplay"] and one of the weekly puzzle challenges from Will Shortz on NPR Weekend Edition [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9264290] and originally attributed to David Edelheit.

The challenge was to take the names of two U.S. States, mix them all together, then rearrange the letters to form the names of two ''different'' U.S. States (so that all four state names differ from one another). What states are these?

The problem was reissued on  [https://tapestry.tucson.az.us/twiki/bin/view/Main/StateNamesPuzzle the Unicon Discussion Web] which includes several solutions with analysis.  Several techniques may be helpful and you may wish to refer to [[wp:Goedel_numbering|GÃ¶del numbering]], [[wp:Equivalence_relation|equivalence relations]], and [[wp:Equivalence_classes|equivalence classes]].  The basic merits of these were discussed in the Unicon Discussion Web.

A second challenge in the form of a set of fictitious new states was also presented.

'''Task:'''<br>
Write a program to solve the challenge using both the original list of states and the fictitious list.

Caveats:
* case and spacing aren't significant - just letters (harmonize case)
* don't expect the names to be in any order - such as being sorted
* don't rely on names to be unique (eliminate duplicates - meaning if Iowa appears twice you can only use it once)

Comma separated list of state names used in the original puzzle:
<pre>
    "Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas",
    "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut",
    "Delaware",
    "Florida", "Georgia", "Hawaii",
    "Idaho", "Illinois", "Indiana", "Iowa",
    "Kansas", "Kentucky", "Louisiana",
    "Maine", "Maryland", "Massachusetts", "Michigan",
    "Minnesota", "Mississippi", "Missouri", "Montana",
    "Nebraska", "Nevada", "New Hampshire", "New Jersey",
    "New Mexico", "New York", "North Carolina", "North Dakota",
    "Ohio", "Oklahoma", "Oregon",
    "Pennsylvania", "Rhode Island",
    "South Carolina", "South Dakota", "Tennessee", "Texas",
    "Utah", "Vermont", "Virginia",
    "Washington", "West Virginia", "Wisconsin", "Wyoming"
</pre>
Comma separated list of additional fictitious state names to be added to the original (Includes a duplicate):
<pre>
"New Kory", "Wen Kory", "York New", "Kory New", "New Kory"
</pre>
