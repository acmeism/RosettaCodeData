Stirling numbers of the first kind, or Stirling cycle numbers, count permutations according to their number
of cycles (counting fixed points as cycles of length one).

They may be defined directly to be the number of permutations of '''n'''
elements with '''k''' disjoint cycles.

Stirling numbers of the first kind express coefficients of polynomial expansions of falling or rising factorials.

Depending on the application, Stirling numbers of the first kind may be "signed"
or "unsigned". Signed Stirling numbers of the first kind arise when the
polynomial expansion is expressed in terms of falling factorials; unsigned when
expressed in terms of rising factorials. The only substantial difference is that,
for signed Stirling numbers of the first kind, values of S1(n, k) are negative
when n + k is odd.

Stirling numbers of the first kind follow the simple identities:

    S1(0, 0) = 1
    S1(n, 0) = 0 if n > 0
    S1(n, k) = 0 if k > n
    S1(n, k) = S1(n - 1, k - 1) + (n - 1) * S1(n - 1, k) # For unsigned
      ''or''
    S1(n, k) = S1(n - 1, k - 1) - (n - 1) * S1(n - 1, k) # For signed


;Task:

:* Write a routine (function, procedure, whatever) to find '''Stirling numbers of the first kind'''. There are several methods to generate Stirling numbers of the first kind. You are free to choose the most appropriate for your language. If your language has a built-in, or easily, publicly available library implementation, it is acceptable to use that.

:* Using the routine, generate and show here, on this page, a table (or triangle) showing the Stirling numbers of the first kind, '''S1(n, k)''', up to '''S1(12, 12)'''. it is optional to show the row / column for n == 0 and k == 0. It is optional to show places where S1(n, k) == 0 (when k > n). You may choose to show signed or unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, just make a note of which was chosen.

:* If your language supports large integers, find and show here, on this page, the maximum value of '''S1(n, k)''' where '''n == 100'''.
