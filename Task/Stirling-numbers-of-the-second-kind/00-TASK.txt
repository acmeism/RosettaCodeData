Stirling numbers of the second kind, or Stirling partition numbers, are the
number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets. They are
closely related to [[Bell numbers]], and may be derived from them.


Stirling numbers of the second kind obey the recurrence relation:

    S2(n, 0) and S2(0, k) = 0 # for n, k > 0
    S2(n, n) = 1
    S2(n + 1, k) = k * S2(n, k) + S2(n, k - 1)



;Task:

:* Write a routine (function, procedure, whatever) to find '''Stirling numbers of the second kind'''. There are several methods to generate Stirling numbers of the second kind. You are free to choose the most appropriate for your language. If your language has a built-in, or easily, publicly available library implementation, it is acceptable to use that.

:* Using the routine, generate and show here, on this page, a table (or triangle) showing the Stirling numbers of the second kind, '''S2(n, k)''', up to '''S2(12, 12)'''. it is optional to show the row / column for n == 0 and k == 0. It is optional to show places where S2(n, k) == 0 (when k > n).

:* If your language supports large integers, find and show here, on this page, the maximum value of '''S2(n, k)''' where '''n == 100'''.
