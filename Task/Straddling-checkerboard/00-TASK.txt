;Task:
Implement functions to encrypt and decrypt a message using the [[wp:Straddling_checkerboard|straddling checkerboard]] method. The checkerboard should take a 28 character alphabet (A-Z plus a full stop and an escape character) and two different numbers representing the blanks in the first row. The output will be a series of decimal digits. 

Numbers should be encrypted by inserting the escape character before each digit, then including the digit unencrypted. This should be reversed for decryption.
