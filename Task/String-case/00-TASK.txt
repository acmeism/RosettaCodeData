;Task:
Take the string &nbsp; &nbsp; '''alphaBETA''' &nbsp; &nbsp; and demonstrate how to convert it to:
:::* &nbsp; upper-case &nbsp; &nbsp; and 
:::* &nbsp; lower-case

<br>
Use the default encoding of a string literal or plain ASCII if there is no string literal in your language.

Note: In some languages alphabets toLower and toUpper is not reversable.

Show any additional case conversion functions &nbsp; (e.g. swapping case, capitalizing the first letter, etc.) &nbsp; that may be included in the library of your language.
