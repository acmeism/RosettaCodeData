;Task:
Find the <em>character</em> and <em>byte</em> length of a string.

This means encodings like [[UTF-8]] need to be handled properly, as there is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship between bytes and characters.

By ''character'', we mean an individual Unicode ''code point'', not a user-visible ''grapheme'' containing combining characters.

For example, the character length of "møøse" is 5 but the byte length is 7 in UTF-8 and 10 in UTF-16.

Non-BMP code points (those between 0x10000 and 0x10FFFF) must also be handled correctly: answers should produce actual character counts in code points, not in code unit counts.

Therefore a string like "𝔘𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔬𝔡𝔢" (consisting of the 7 Unicode characters U+1D518  U+1D52B U+1D526 U+1D520 U+1D52C U+1D521 U+1D522) is 7 characters long, '''not''' 14 UTF-16 code units; and it is 28 bytes long whether encoded in UTF-8 or in  UTF-16.

Please mark your examples with <nowiki>===Character Length=== or ===Byte Length===</nowiki>.

If your language is capable of providing the string length in graphemes, mark those examples with <nowiki>===Grapheme Length===</nowiki>.

For example, the string "J̲o̲s̲é̲" ("J\x{332}o\x{332}s\x{332}e\x{301}\x{332}") has 4 user-visible graphemes, 9 characters (code points), and 14 bytes when encoded in UTF-8.
