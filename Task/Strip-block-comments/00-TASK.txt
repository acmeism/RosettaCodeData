A block comment begins with a &nbsp; ''beginning delimiter'' &nbsp; and ends with a &nbsp; ''ending delimiter'', &nbsp; including the delimiters. &nbsp; These delimiters are often multi-character sequences.


;Task:
Strip block comments from program text (of a programming language much like classic [[C]]). 

Your demos should at least handle simple, non-nested and multi-line block comment delimiters.  

The block comment delimiters are the two-character sequences:
:::* &nbsp; &nbsp; <big><big> '''/*''' </big></big> &nbsp; &nbsp; (beginning delimiter)
:::* &nbsp; &nbsp; <big><big> '''*/''' </big></big> &nbsp; &nbsp; (ending delimiter)


Sample text for stripping:
<pre>
  /**
   * Some comments
   * longer comments here that we can parse.
   *
   * Rahoo 
   */
   function subroutine() {
    a = /* inline comment */ b + c ;
   }
   /*/ <-- tricky comments */

   /**
    * Another comment.
    */
    function something() {
    }
</pre>

;Extra credit:
Ensure that the stripping code is not hard-coded to the particular delimiters described above, but instead allows the caller to specify them. &nbsp; (If your language supports them, &nbsp; [[Optional parameters|optional parameters]] &nbsp; may be useful for this.)
