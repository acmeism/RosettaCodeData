If the program uses UTF-8 or UTF-16, &nbsp; it must work on any valid Unicode code point, 
whether in the &nbsp; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane Basic Multilingual Plane] &nbsp; or above it. 

The program must reference logical characters (code points), &nbsp; not 8-bit code units for UTF-8 or 16-bit code units for UTF-16. 

Programs for other encodings (such as 8-bit ASCII, or EUC-JP) are not required to handle all Unicode characters.
