In this task display a substring:

* starting from <tt>n</tt> characters in and of <tt>m</tt> length;
* starting from <tt>n</tt> characters in, up to the end of the string;
* whole string minus last character;
* starting from a known character within the string and of <tt>m</tt> length;
* starting from a known substring within the string and of <tt>m</tt> length.

If the program uses UTF-8 or UTF-16, it must work on any valid Unicode code point,
whether in the Basic Multilingual Plane or above it.
The program must reference logical characters (code points), not 8-bit code units for UTF-8 or 16-bit code units for UTF-16. Programs for other encodings (such as 8-bit ASCII, or EUC-JP) are not required to handle all Unicode characters.
