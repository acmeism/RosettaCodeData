A ''subtractive generator'' calculates a sequence of [[random number generator|random numbers]], where each number is congruent to the subtraction of two previous numbers from the sequence. <br>
The formula is

* <math>r_n = r_{(n - i)} - r_{(n - j)} \pmod m</math>

for some fixed values of <math>i</math>, <math>j</math> and <math>m</math>, all positive integers. Supposing that <math>i > j</math>, then the state of this generator is the list of the previous numbers from <math>r_{n - i}</math> to <math>r_{n - 1}</math>. Many states generate uniform random integers from <math>0</math> to <math>m - 1</math>, but some states are bad. A state, filled with zeros, generates only zeros. If <math>m</math> is even, then a state, filled with even numbers, generates only even numbers. More generally, if <math>f</math> is a factor of <math>m</math>, then a state, filled with multiples of <math>f</math>, generates only multiples of <math>f</math>.

All subtractive generators have some weaknesses. The formula correlates <math>r_n</math>, <math>r_{(n - i)}</math> and <math>r_{(n - j)}</math>; these three numbers are not independent, as true random numbers would be. Anyone who observes <math>i</math> consecutive numbers can predict the next numbers, so the generator is not cryptographically secure. The authors of ''Freeciv'' ([http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv/trunk/utility/rand.c?view=markup utility/rand.c]) and ''xpat2'' (src/testit2.c) knew another problem: the low bits are less random than the high bits.

The subtractive generator has a better reputation than the [[linear congruential generator]], perhaps because it holds more state. A subtractive generator might never multiply numbers: this helps where multiplication is slow. A subtractive generator might also avoid division: the value of <math>r_{(n - i)} - r_{(n - j)}</math> is always between <math>-m</math> and <math>m</math>, so a program only needs to add <math>m</math> to negative numbers.

The choice of <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> affects the period of the generator. A popular choice is <math>i = 55</math> and <math>j = 24</math>, so the formula is

* <math>r_n = r_{(n - 55)} - r_{(n - 24)} \pmod m</math>

The subtractive generator from ''xpat2'' uses

* <math>r_n = r_{(n - 55)} - r_{(n - 24)} \pmod{10^9}</math>

The implementation is by J. Bentley and comes from program_tools/universal.c of [ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/ the DIMACS (netflow) archive] at Rutgers University. It credits Knuth, [[wp:The Art of Computer Programming|''TAOCP'']], Volume 2, Section 3.2.2 (Algorithm A).

Bentley uses this clever algorithm to seed the generator.

# Start with a single <math>seed</math> in range <math>0</math> to <math>10^9 - 1</math>.
# Set <math>s_0 = seed</math> and <math>s_1 = 1</math>. The inclusion of <math>s_1 = 1</math> avoids some bad states (like all zeros, or all multiples of 10).
# Compute <math>s_2, s_3, ..., s_{54}</math> using the subtractive formula <math>s_n = s_{(n - 2)} - s_{(n - 1)} \pmod{10^9}</math>.
# Reorder these 55 values so <math>r_0 = s_{34}</math>, <math>r_1 = s_{13}</math>, <math>r_2 = s_{47}</math>, ..., <math>r_n = s_{(34 * (n + 1) \pmod{55})}</math>.
#* This is the same order as <math>s_0 = r_{54}</math>, <math>s_1 = r_{33}</math>, <math>s_2 = r_{12}</math>, ..., <math>s_n = r_{((34 * n) - 1 \pmod{55})}</math>.
#* This rearrangement exploits how 34 and 55 are relatively prime.
# Compute the next 165 values <math>r_{55}</math> to <math>r_{219}</math>. Store the last 55 values.

This generator yields the sequence <math>r_{220}</math>, <math>r_{221}</math>, <math>r_{222}</math> and so on. For example, if the seed is 292929, then the sequence begins with <math>r_{220} = 467478574</math>, <math>r_{221} = 512932792</math>, <math>r_{222} = 539453717</math>. By starting at <math>r_{220}</math>, this generator avoids a bias from the first numbers of the sequence. This generator must store the last 55 numbers of the sequence, so to compute the next <math>r_n</math>. Any array or list would work; a [[ring buffer]] is ideal but not necessary.

Implement a subtractive generator that replicates the sequences from ''xpat2''.
