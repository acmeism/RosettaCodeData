Sum And Product is a room.

To decide which number is the sum of (N - number) and (M - number) (this is summing):
	decide on N + M.

To decide which number is the product of (N - number) and (M - number) (this is production):
	decide on N * M.

When play begins:
	let L be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	say "List: [L in brace notation], sum = [summing reduction of L], product = [production reduction of L].";
	end the story.
