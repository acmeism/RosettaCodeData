   x := y := 0   # := is right associative so, y is assigned 0, then x
   1 < x < 99    # comparison operators are left associative so, 1 < x returns x (if it is greater than 1), then x < 99 returns 99 if the comparison succeeds
   (sum := 0)    # returns a reference to sum which can in turn be used with augmented assignment +:=
