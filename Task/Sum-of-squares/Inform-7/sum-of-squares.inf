Sum Of Squares is a room.

To decide which number is the sum of (N - number) and (M - number) (this is summing):
	decide on N + M.

To decide which number is (N - number) squared (this is squaring):
	decide on N * N.

To decide which number is the sum of squares of (L - list of numbers):
	decide on the summing reduction of squaring applied to L.

When play begins:
	say the sum of squares of {};
	say line break;
	say the sum of squares of {1, 2, 3};
	end the story.
