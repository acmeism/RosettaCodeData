A [[wp:superellipse|superellipse]] is a geometric figure defined as the set of all points (x, y) with 


::: <big><big><math>\left|\frac{x}{a}\right|^n\! + \left|\frac{y}{b}\right|^n\! = 1,</math></big></big>

<br>
where <big>''n''</big>, <big>''a''</big>, and <big>''b''</big> are positive numbers.


;Task
