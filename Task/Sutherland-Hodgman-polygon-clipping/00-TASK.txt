The &nbsp; [[wp:Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm|Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm]] &nbsp; finds the polygon that is the intersection between an arbitrary polygon (the “subject polygon”) and a convex polygon (the “clip polygon”). 

It is used in computer graphics (especially 2D graphics) to reduce the complexity of a scene being displayed by eliminating parts of a polygon that do not need to be displayed.


;Task:
Take the closed polygon defined by the points:
: <big><math>[(50, 150), (200, 50), (350, 150), (350, 300), (250, 300), (200, 250), (150, 350), (100, 250), (100, 200)]</math></big>
and clip it by the rectangle defined by the points:
: <big><math>[(100, 100), (300, 100), (300, 300), (100, 300)]</math></big>

Print the sequence of points that define the resulting clipped polygon.


;Extra credit:
Display all three polygons on a graphical surface, using a different color for each polygon and filling the resulting polygon. 

(When displaying you may use either a north-west or a south-west origin, whichever is more convenient for your display mechanism.)
