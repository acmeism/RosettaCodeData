Given two [[set]]s ''A'' and ''B'', where ''A'' contains:

* John
* Bob
* Mary
* Serena

and ''B'' contains:

* Jim
* Mary
* John
* Bob

compute

:<math>(A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A).</math>

That is, enumerate the items that are in ''A'' or ''B'' but not both. This set is called the [[wp:Symmetric difference|symmetric difference]] of ''A'' and ''B''.

In other words: <math>(A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)</math> (the set of items that are in at least one of ''A'' or ''B'' minus the set of items that are in both ''A'' and ''B'').

Optionally, give the individual differences (<math>A \setminus B</math> and <math>B \setminus A</math>) as well.

;Notes
# If your code uses lists of items to represent sets then ensure duplicate items in lists are correctly handled. For example two lists representing sets of <code>a = ["John", "Serena", "Bob", "Mary", "Serena"]</code> and <code>b = ["Jim", "Mary", "John", "Jim", "Bob"]</code> should produce the result of just two strings: <code>["Serena", "Jim"]</code>, in any order.
# In the mathematical notation above <code>A \ B</code> gives the set of items in A that are not in B; <code>A ∪ B</code> gives the set of items in both A and B, (their ''union''); and <code>A ∩ B</code> gives the set of items that are in both A and B (their ''intersection'').
