If NOTES has arguments, the current date and time are appended to the local NOTES.TXT followed by a newline. Then all the arguments, joined with spaces, prepended with a tab, and appended with a trailing newline, are written to NOTES.TXT. If NOTES.TXT doesn't already exist in the current directory then a new NOTES.TXT file should be created.
