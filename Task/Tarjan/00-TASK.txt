Tarjan's algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory for finding the strongly connected components of a graph. 

It runs in linear time, matching the time bound for alternative methods including Kosaraju's algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm. 

Tarjan's Algorithm is named for its discoverer, Robert Tarjan.
