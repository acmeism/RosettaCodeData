On a set of coasters we have, there's a picture of a teacup. &nbsp; On the rim of the teacup the word &nbsp; '''TEA''' &nbsp; appears a number of times separated by bullet characters &nbsp; (&bull;). 

It occurred to me that if the bullet were removed and the words run together, &nbsp; you could start at any letter and still end up with a meaningful three-letter word. 

So start at the &nbsp; '''T''' &nbsp; and read &nbsp; '''TEA'''. &nbsp; Start at the &nbsp; '''E''' &nbsp; and read &nbsp; '''EAT''', &nbsp; or start at the &nbsp; '''A''' &nbsp; and read &nbsp; '''ATE'''.

That got me thinking that maybe there are other words that could be used rather that &nbsp; '''TEA'''. &nbsp; And that's just English. &nbsp; What about Italian or Greek or ... um ... Telugu. 

For English, we will use the unixdict (now) located at: &nbsp; [http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt unixdict.txt]. 

(This will maintain continuity with other Rosetta Code tasks that also use it.)


;Task:
Search for a set of words that could be printed around the edge of a teacup. &nbsp; The words in each set are to be of the same length, that length being greater than two (thus precluding &nbsp; '''AH''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''HA''', &nbsp; for example.) 

Having listed a set, for example &nbsp; ['''ate tea eat'''], &nbsp; refrain from displaying permutations of that set, e.g.: &nbsp; ['''eat tea ate'''] &nbsp; etc. 

The words should also be made of more than one letter &nbsp; (thus precluding &nbsp; '''III''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''OOO''' &nbsp; etc.) 

The relationship between these words is (using ATE as an example) that the first letter of the first becomes the last letter of the second. &nbsp; The first letter of the second becomes the last letter of the third. &nbsp; So &nbsp; '''ATE''' &nbsp; becomes &nbsp; '''TEA''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''TEA''' &nbsp; becomes &nbsp; '''EAT'''. 

All of the possible permutations, using this particular permutation technique, must be words in the list. 

The set you generate for &nbsp; '''ATE''' &nbsp; will never included the word &nbsp; '''ETA''' &nbsp; as that cannot be reached via the first-to-last movement method. 

Display one line for each set of teacup rim words.
