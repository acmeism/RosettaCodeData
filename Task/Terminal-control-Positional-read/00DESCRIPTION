[[Terminal Control::task| ]]
Determine the character displayed on the screen at column 3, row 6 and store that character in a variable. Note that it is permissible to utilize system or language provided methods or system provided facilities, system maintained records or available buffers or system maintained display records to achieve this task, rather than query the terminal directly, if those methods are more usual for the system type or language.
