[[Terminal Control::task| ]]

;Task:
Make the terminal running the program ring its "bell". 


On modern terminal emulators, this may be done by playing some other sound which might or might not be configurable, or by flashing the title bar or inverting the colors of the screen, but was classically a physical bell within the terminal. &nbsp; It is usually used to indicate a problem where a wrong character has been typed.

In most terminals, if the &nbsp; [[wp:Bell character|Bell character]] &nbsp; (ASCII code '''7''', &nbsp; <big><code> \a </code></big> in C) &nbsp; is printed by the program, it will cause the terminal to ring its bell. &nbsp; This is a function of the terminal, and is independent of the programming language of the program, other than the ability to print a particular character to standard out.
