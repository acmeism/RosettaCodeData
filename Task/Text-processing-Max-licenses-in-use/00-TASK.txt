A company currently pays a fixed sum for the use of a particular licensed software package. &nbsp; In determining if it has a good deal it decides to calculate its maximum use of the software from its license management log file.

Assume the software's licensing daemon faithfully records a checkout event when a copy of the software starts and a checkin event when the software finishes to its log file. 

An example of  checkout and  checkin events are:
  License OUT @ 2008/10/03_23:51:05 for job 4974
  ...
  License IN  @ 2008/10/04_00:18:22 for job 4974


;Task:
Save the 10,000 line log file from &nbsp; [http://rosettacode.org/resources/mlijobs.txt <big> here</big>] &nbsp; into a local file, then write a program to scan the file extracting both the maximum licenses that were out at any time, and the time(s) at which this occurs.

Mirror of log file available as a zip [https://github.com/thundergnat/rc/blob/master/resouces/mlijobs.zip here] (offsite mirror).
