When entering text on a phone's digital pad it is possible that a particular combination of digits corresponds to more than one word. Such are called textonyms.

Assuming the digit keys are mapped to letters as follows:
     2 -> ABC
     3 -> DEF
     4 -> GHI
     5 -> JKL
     6 -> MNO
     7 -> PQRS
     8 -> TUV
     9 -> WXYZ  


;Task:
Write a program that finds textonyms in a list of words such as &nbsp; 
[[Textonyms/wordlist]] &nbsp; or &nbsp; 
[http://www.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt unixdict.txt].

The task should produce a report:

 There are #{0} words in #{1} which can be represented by the digit key mapping.
 They require #{2} digit combinations to represent them.
 #{3} digit combinations represent Textonyms.

Where:
 #{0} is the number of words in the list which can be represented by the digit key mapping.
 #{1} is the URL of the wordlist being used.
 #{2} is the number of digit combinations required to represent the words in #{0}.
 #{3} is the number of #{2} which represent more than one word.

At your discretion show a couple of examples of your solution displaying Textonyms. 

E.G.:

  2748424767 -> "Briticisms", "criticisms"


;Extra credit:
Use a word list and keypad mapping other than English.
