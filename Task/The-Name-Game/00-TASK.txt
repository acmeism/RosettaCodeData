Write a program that accepts a name as input and outputs the lyrics to the Shirley Ellis song "The Name Game".


The regular verse

Unless your name begins with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U), 'B', 'F' or 'M' you don't have to care about special rules.
The verse for the name 'Gary' would be like this:

    Gary, Gary, bo-bary
    Banana-fana fo-fary
    Fee-fi-mo-mary
    Gary! 

At the end of every line, the name gets repeated without the first letter: Gary becomes ary
If we take (X) as the full name (Gary) and (Y) as the name without the first letter (ary) the verse would look like this:

    (X), (X), bo-b(Y)
    Banana-fana fo-f(Y)
    Fee-fi-mo-m(Y)
    (X)! 

Vowel as first letter of the name

If you have a vowel as the first letter of your name (e.g. Earl) you do not truncate the name.
The verse looks like this:

    Earl, Earl, bo-bearl
    Banana-fana fo-fearl
    Fee-fi-mo-mearl
    Earl! 

'B', 'F' or 'M' as first letter of the name

In case of a 'B', an 'F' or an 'M' (e.g. Billy, Felix, Mary) there is a special rule.
The line which would 'rebuild' the name (e.g. bo-billy) is sung without the first letter of the name.
The verse for the name Billy looks like this:

    Billy, Billy, bo-illy
    Banana-fana fo-filly
    Fee-fi-mo-milly
    Billy! 

For the name 'Felix', this would be right:

    Felix, Felix, bo-belix
    Banana-fana fo-elix
    Fee-fi-mo-melix
    Felix!
