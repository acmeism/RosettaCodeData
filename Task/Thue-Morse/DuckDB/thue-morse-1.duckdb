create or replace function t(n) as (
  with recursive mx as (select (ceil(log(n) / log(2))) as mx),
  cte as (
    select '0' as a,
            0 as ix
    union all
    select replace(replace(hex(a),'30','01'),'31','10') as a,
           ix+1 as ix
    from cte, mx
    where ix < mx
  )
  select last(a[n] order by ix) from cte
);

## Example:
select t(1),  t(2),  t(3), t(4), t(5), t(100);
