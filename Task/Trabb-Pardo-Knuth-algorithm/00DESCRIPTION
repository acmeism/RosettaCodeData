The TPK algorithm is an early example of a programming chrestomathy.
It was used in Donald Knuth and Luis Trabb Pardo's Stanford tech report [http://bitsavers.org/pdf/stanford/cs_techReports/STAN-CS-76-562_EarlyDevelPgmgLang_Aug76.pdf The Early Development of Programming Languages].
The report traces the early history of work in developing computer languages in the 1940s and 1950s, giving several translations of the algorithm.

From the [[wp:Trabb Pardo–Knuth algorithm|wikipedia entry]]:

 '''ask''' for 11 numbers to be read into a sequence ''S''
 '''reverse''' sequence ''S''
 '''for each''' ''item'' '''in''' sequence ''S''
     ''result'' ''':=''' '''call''' a function to do an ''operation''
     '''if''' ''result'' overflows
         '''alert''' user
     '''else'''
         '''print''' ''result''

The task is to implement the algorithm:
# Use the function: &nbsp; &nbsp; <big><math>f(x) = |x|^{0.5} + 5x^3</math></big>
# The overflow condition is an answer of greater than 400.
# The 'user alert' should not stop processing of other items of the sequence.
# Print a prompt before accepting '''eleven''', textual, numeric inputs.
# You may optionally print the item as well as its associated result, but the results must be in reverse order of input.
# The sequence &nbsp; ''' ''S'' ''' &nbsp; may be 'implied' and so not shown explicitly.
# ''Print and show the program in action from a typical run here''. (If the output is graphical rather than text then either add a screendump or describe textually what is displayed).
