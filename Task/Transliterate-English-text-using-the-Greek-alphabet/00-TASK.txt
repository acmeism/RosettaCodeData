;Rules

A rather silly little task intended as a bit of fun as well as a simple exercise in text substitution. So, if you're a Greek speaker or an expert in ancient Greek, please don't take it too seriously!

As there isn't a one-to-one correspondence between the English and Greek alphabets, we need some rules:

{| class="wikitable"
! Greek letter !! Corresponding English letter(s)
|-
|alpha || a
|-
|beta || b or v
|-
|gamma || g
|-
|delta || d
|-
|epsilon ||e (but not ee)
|-
|zeta  || z
|-
|eta   || h or ee (but not ch, kh, ph, rh or th)
|-
|theta || th
|-
|iota  || i or j
|-
|kappa || c, k, q or ck (but not ch and kh)
|-
|lambda || l
|-
|mu || m
|-
|nu || n
|-
|xi || x
|-
|omicron || o (but not oo)
|-
|pi || p (but not ph or ps)
|-
|rho || r or rh
|-
|sigma || s (but not ps)
|-
|tau || t (but not th)
|-
|upsilon || u or y
|-
|phi || f or ph
|-
|chi || ch or kh
|-
|psi || ps
|-
|omega || w or oo
|}

In the case of lower-case sigma, use '''ς''' when '''s''' is the final letter of an English word or '''σ''' otherwise.

Ignore Greek diacritics (accents and breathings) but use the same capitalization, spacing and punctuation as in the English text.

;Example

English:  The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

Greek:    Θε κυικ βροων φοξ ιυμπεδ οβερ θε λαζυ δογ.

;Task
Transliterate the following English text into Greek using the above rules:
<pre>
I was looking at some rhododendrons in my back garden,
dressed in my khaki shorts, when the telephone rang.

As I answered it, I cheerfully glimpsed that the July sun
caused a fragment of black pine wax to ooze on the velvet quilt
laying in my patio.
</pre>
If your language does not support the printing of non-ascii characters, then you can instead transliterate the following lower-case pangram:
<pre>
sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
</pre>
Just represent the Greek letters by their names in angle brackets. For example:

<pre>the dog => <theta><epsilon> <delta><omicron><gamma></pre>
