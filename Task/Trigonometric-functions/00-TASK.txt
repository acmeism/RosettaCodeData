;Task:
If your language has a library or built-in functions for trigonometry, show examples of:
::* &nbsp; sine
::* &nbsp; cosine
::* &nbsp; tangent
::* &nbsp; inverses &nbsp; (of the above)
<br>using the same angle in radians and degrees. 

For the non-inverse functions, &nbsp; each radian/degree pair should use arguments that evaluate to the same angle &nbsp; (that is, it's not necessary to use the same angle for all three regular functions as long as the two sine calls use the same angle). 

For the inverse functions, &nbsp; use the same number and convert its answer to radians and degrees. 

If your language does not have trigonometric functions available or only has some available, &nbsp; write functions to calculate the functions based on any &nbsp; [[wp:List of trigonometric identities|known approximation or identity]].
