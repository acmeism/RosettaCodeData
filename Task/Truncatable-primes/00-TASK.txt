A truncatable prime is a prime number that when you successively remove digits from one end of the prime, you are left with a new prime number.


;Examples:
The number '''997''' is called a ''left-truncatable prime'' as the numbers '''997''', '''97''', and '''7''' are all prime. 

The number '''7393''' is a ''right-truncatable prime'' as the numbers '''7393''', '''739''', '''73''', and '''7''' formed by removing digits from its right are also prime. 

No zeroes are allowed in truncatable primes.


;Task:
The task is to find the largest left-truncatable and right-truncatable primes less than one million (base 10 is implied).
