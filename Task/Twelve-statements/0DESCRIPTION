5.  The 3 preceding statements are all false.
6.  Exactly 4 of the odd-numbered statements are true.
7.  Either statement 2 or 3 is true, but not both.
8.  If statement 7 is true, then 5 and 6 are both true.
9.  Exactly 3 of the first 6 statements are true.

When you get tired of trying to figure it out in your head, write a program to solve it, and print the correct answer or answers.

Extra credit: also print out a table of near misses, that is, solutions that are contradicted by only a single statement.
