As the world gets smaller each day, internationalization becomes more and more important. &nbsp; For handling multiple languages, [[Unicode]] is your best friend. 

It is a very capable tool, but also quite complex compared to older single- and double-byte character encodings. 

How well prepared is your programming language for Unicode? 


;Task:
Discuss and demonstrate its unicode awareness and capabilities. 


Some suggested topics:
:* &nbsp; How easy is it to present Unicode strings in source code? 
:* &nbsp; Can Unicode literals be written directly, or be part of identifiers/keywords/etc?
:* &nbsp; How well can the language communicate with the rest of the world? 
:* &nbsp; Is it good at input/output with Unicode?
:* &nbsp; Is it convenient to manipulate Unicode strings in the language?
:* &nbsp; How broad/deep does the language support Unicode? 
:* &nbsp; What encodings (e.g. UTF-8, UTF-16, etc) can be used? 
:* &nbsp; Does it support normalization?


;Note:
This task is a bit unusual in that it encourages general discussion rather than clever coding.
