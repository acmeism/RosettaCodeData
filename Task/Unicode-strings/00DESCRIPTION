As the world gets smaller each day, internationalization becomes more and more important. For handling multiple languages, [[Unicode]] is your best friend. <br>
It is a very capable tool, but also quite complex compared to older single-
and double-byte character encodings. How well prepared is your programming language for Unicode? Discuss and demonstrate its unicode awareness and capabilities.

Some suggested topics:

* How easy is it to present Unicode strings in source code? Can Unicode literals be written directly, or be part of identifiers/keywords/etc?
* How well can the language communicate with the rest of the world? Is it good at input/output with Unicode?
* Is it convenient to manipulate Unicode strings in the language?
* How broad/deep does the language support Unicode? What encodings (e.g. UTF-8, UTF-16, etc) can be used? Normalization?

'''Note''' This task is a bit unusual in that it encourages general discussion
rather than clever coding.
