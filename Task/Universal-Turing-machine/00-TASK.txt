One of the foundational mathematical constructs behind computer science 
is the [[wp:Universal Turing machine|universal Turing Machine]].  


(Alan Turing introduced the idea of such a machine in 1936â€“1937.)

Indeed one way to definitively prove that a language 
is [[wp:Turing_completeness|turing-complete]] 
is to implement a universal Turing machine in it.


;Task:
Simulate such a machine capable 
of taking the definition of any other Turing machine and executing it. 
 
Of course, you will not have an infinite tape, 
but you should emulate this as much as is possible.  

The three permissible actions on the tape are "left", "right" and "stay".

To test your universal Turing machine (and prove your programming language 
is Turing complete!), you should execute the following two Turing machines 
based on the following definitions.


'''Simple incrementer'''
* '''States:''' q0, qf
* '''Initial state:''' q0
* '''Terminating states:''' qf
* '''Permissible symbols:''' B, 1
* '''Blank symbol:''' B
* '''Rules:'''
** (q0, 1, 1, right, q0)
** (q0, B, 1, stay,  qf)

<br>
The input for this machine should be a tape of <code>1 1 1</code>


'''Three-state busy beaver'''
* '''States:''' a, b, c, halt
* '''Initial state:''' a
* '''Terminating states:''' halt
* '''Permissible symbols:''' 0, 1
* '''Blank symbol:''' 0
* '''Rules:'''
** (a, 0, 1, right, b)
** (a, 1, 1, left,  c)
** (b, 0, 1, left,  a)
** (b, 1, 1, right, b)
** (c, 0, 1, left,  b)
** (c, 1, 1, stay,  halt)

<br>
The input for this machine should be an empty tape.


'''Bonus:'''

'''5-state, 2-symbol probable Busy Beaver machine from Wikipedia'''
* '''States:''' A, B, C, D, E, H
* '''Initial state:''' A
* '''Terminating states:''' H
* '''Permissible symbols:''' 0, 1
* '''Blank symbol:''' 0
* '''Rules:'''
** (A, 0, 1, right, B)
** (A, 1, 1, left,  C)
** (B, 0, 1, right, C)
** (B, 1, 1, right, B)
** (C, 0, 1, right, D)
** (C, 1, 0, left,  E)
** (D, 0, 1, left,  A)
** (D, 1, 1, left,  D)
** (E, 0, 1, stay,  H)
** (E, 1, 0, left,  A)

<br>
The input for this machine should be an empty tape.

This machine runs for more than 47 millions steps.
