;Why doesn't syntax highlighting work on this page ?:
Currently, there is a limit on how many &lt;syntaxhighlight&gt; tags can appear on a page, so only the first few languages get highlighting, the rest are shown in monochrome.<br/>
You could try "manual highlighting", possibly using one of the highlighters on [[Syntax highlighting using Mediawiki formatting]] or something similar.
