A [[wp:Vampire_number|vampire number]] is a natural decimal number with an even number of digits, &nbsp; that can be factored into two integers. 

These two factors are called the &nbsp; ''fangs'', &nbsp; and must have the following properties:
::* &nbsp; they each contain half the number of the decimal digits of the original number
::* &nbsp; together they consist of exactly the same decimal digits as the original number
::* &nbsp; at most one of them has a trailing zero


An example of a vampire number and its fangs: &nbsp; <code> 1260 : (21, 60) </code>


;Task:
# Print the first &nbsp; '''25''' &nbsp; vampire numbers and their fangs. 
# Check if the following numbers are vampire numbers and, &nbsp; if  so, &nbsp; print them and their fangs: 
<big><code> 16758243290880,  24959017348650,  14593825548650 </code></big>


Note that a vampire number can have more than one pair of fangs.
