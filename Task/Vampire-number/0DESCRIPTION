A [[wp:Vampire_number|vampire number]] is a natural number with an even number of digits, that can be factored into two integers. These two factors are called the ''fangs'', and must have the following properties:
* they each contain half the number of the digits of the original number
* together they consist of exactly the same digits as the original number
* at most one of them has a trailing zero
An example of a Vampire number and its fangs: <code>1260 : (21, 60)</code>
