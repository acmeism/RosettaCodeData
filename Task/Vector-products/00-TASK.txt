A vector is defined as having three dimensions as being represented by an ordered collection of three numbers: &nbsp; (X, Y, Z). 

If you imagine a graph with the &nbsp; '''x''' &nbsp; and &nbsp; '''y''' &nbsp; axis being at right angles to each other and having a third, &nbsp; '''z''' &nbsp; axis coming out of the page, then a triplet of numbers, &nbsp; (X, Y, Z) &nbsp; would represent a point in the region, &nbsp; and a vector from the origin to the point.

Given the vectors:
        <big> A = (a<sub>1</sub>,  a<sub>2</sub>,  a<sub>3</sub>) </big>
        <big> B = (b<sub>1</sub>,  b<sub>2</sub>,  b<sub>3</sub>) </big>
        <big> C = (c<sub>1</sub>,  c<sub>2</sub>,  c<sub>3</sub>) </big>
then the following common vector products are defined:
* '''The dot product''' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a scalar quantity)
:::: <big> A • B = a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>1</sub> &nbsp; + &nbsp; a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>2</sub> &nbsp; + &nbsp;  a<sub>3</sub>b<sub>3</sub> </big> 
* '''The cross product''' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a vector quantity)
:::: <big> A x B = (a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;  - &nbsp; a<sub>3</sub>b<sub>2</sub>, &nbsp; &nbsp; a<sub>3</sub>b<sub>1</sub> &nbsp; - &nbsp; a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>3</sub>, &nbsp; &nbsp; a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub> &nbsp; - &nbsp; a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>1</sub>) </big> 
* '''The scalar triple product''' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a scalar quantity)
:::: <big> A • (B x C) </big>
* '''The vector triple product''' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a vector quantity)
:::: <big> A x (B x C) </big>
