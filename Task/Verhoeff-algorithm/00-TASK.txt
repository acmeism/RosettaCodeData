;Description
The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verhoeff_algorithm Verhoeff algorithm] is a checksum formula for error detection developed by the Dutch mathematician Jacobus Verhoeff and first published in 1969. It was the first decimal check digit algorithm which detects all single-digit errors, and all transposition errors involving two adjacent digits, which was at the time thought impossible with such a code. 

As the workings of the algorithm are clearly described in the linked Wikipedia article they will not be repeated here. 

;Task:
Write routines, methods, procedures etc. in your language to generate a Verhoeff checksum digit for non-negative integers of any length and to validate the result. A combined routine is also acceptable.

The more mathematically minded may prefer to generate the 3 tables required from the description provided rather than to hard-code them.

Write your routines in such a way that they can optionally display digit by digit calculations as in the Wikipedia example.

Use your routines to calculate check digits for the integers: '''236''', '''12345''' and '''123456789012''' and then validate them. Also attempt to validate the same integers if the check digits in all cases were '''9''' rather than what they actually are.

Display digit by digit calculations for the first two integers but not for the third.
