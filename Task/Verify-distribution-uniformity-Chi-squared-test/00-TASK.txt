;Task:
Write a function to determine whether a given set of frequency counts could plausibly have come from a uniform distribution by using the [[wp:Pearson's chi-square test|<math>\chi^2</math> test]] with a significance level of 5%.  

The function should return a boolean that is true if and only if the distribution is one that a uniform distribution (with appropriate number of degrees of freedom) may be expected to produce.

Note: normally a two-tailed test would be used for this kind of problem.
