<small>This task is an adjunct to [[Seven-sided dice from five-sided dice]].</small>


;Task:
Create a function to check that the random integers returned from a small-integer generator function have uniform distribution.


The function should take as arguments:
* The function (or object) producing random integers.
* The number of times to call the integer generator.
* A 'delta' value of some sort that indicates how close to a flat distribution is close enough.


The function should produce:
* Some indication of the distribution achieved.
* An 'error' if the distribution is not flat enough.


Show the distribution checker working when the produced distribution is flat enough and when it is not. (Use a generator from [[Seven-sided dice from five-sided dice]]).
