Implement a [[wp:Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher|Vigenère cypher]],
both encryption and decryption.

The program should handle keys and text of unequal length,
and should capitalize everything and discard non-alphabetic characters. <br>
(If your program handles non-alphabetic characters in another way,
make a note of it.)
