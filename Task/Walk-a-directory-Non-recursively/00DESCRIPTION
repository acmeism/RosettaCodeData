Walk a given directory and print the ''names'' of files matching a given pattern.  (How is "pattern" defined?  substring match?  DOS pattern?  BASH pattern?  ZSH pattern?  Perl regular expression?)

'''Note:''' This task is for non-recursive methods.  These tasks should read a ''single directory'', not an entire directory tree.  For code examples that read entire directory trees, see [[Walk Directory Tree]]

'''Note:''' Please be careful when running any code presented here.
