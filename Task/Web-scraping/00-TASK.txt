;Task:
Create a program that downloads the time from this URL: &nbsp; [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl] &nbsp; and then prints the current UTC time by extracting just the UTC time from the web page's [[HTML]]. Alternatively, if the above url is not working, grab the first date/time off this page's talk page.

If possible, only use libraries that come at no ''extra'' monetary cost with the programming language and that are widely available and popular such as [http://www.cpan.org/ CPAN] for Perl or [[Boost]] for C++.
