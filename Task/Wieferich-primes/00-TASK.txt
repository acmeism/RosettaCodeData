In number theory, a '''Wieferich prime''' is a prime number ''' ''p'' ''' such that ''' ''p<sup>2</sup>'' ''' evenly divides ''' ''2<sup>(p − 1)</sup> − 1'' '''.


It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Wieferich primes, but as of March 2021,only two have been identified.


;Task 

* Write a routine (function procedure, whatever) to find Wieferich primes.

* Use that routine to identify and display all of the Wieferich primes less than 5000.
