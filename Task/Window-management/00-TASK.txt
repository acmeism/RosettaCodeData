Treat windows or at least window identities as [[wp:First-class_object|first class objects]].

* Store window identities in variables, compare them for equality.
* Provide examples of performing some of the following:
** hide, 
** show, 
** close, 
** minimize, 
** maximize, 
** move, &nbsp; &nbsp; and 
** resize a window. 


The window of interest may or may not have been created by your program.
