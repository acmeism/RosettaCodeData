[[wp:Wireworld|Wireworld]] is a cellular automaton with some similarities to [[Conway's Game of Life]]. It is capable of doing sophisticated computations with appropriate programs (it is actually [[wp:Turing-complete|Turing complete]]), and is much simpler to program for.

A wireworld arena consists of a cartesian grid of cells, each of which can be in one of four states. All cell transitions happen simultaneously. The cell transition rules are this:
{| class=wikitable
|-
! Input State
! Output State
! Condition
|-
| <tt>empty</tt>
| <tt>empty</tt>
|
|-
| <tt>electron&nbsp;head&nbsp;</tt>
| <tt>electron&nbsp;tail&nbsp;</tt>
|
|-
| <tt>electron&nbsp;tail&nbsp;</tt>
| <tt>conductor</tt>
|
|-
| valign=top | <tt>conductor</tt>
| valign=top | <tt>electron&nbsp;head&nbsp;</tt>
| if 1 or 2 cells in the [[wp:Moore neighborhood|neighborhood]] of the cell are in the state “<tt>electron head</tt>”
|-
| <tt>conductor</tt>
| <tt>conductor</tt>
| otherwise
|}

To implement this task, create a program that reads a wireworld program from a file and displays an animation of the processing. Here is a sample description file (using "<tt>H</tt>" for an electron head, "<tt>t</tt>" for a tail, "<tt>.</tt>" for a conductor and a space for empty) you may wish to test with, which demonstrates two cycle-3 generators and an inhibit gate:
<pre>
tH.........
.   .
   ...
.   .
Ht.. ......
</pre>
While text-only implementations of this task are possible, mapping cells to pixels is advisable if you wish to be able to display large designs. The logic is not significantly more complex.
