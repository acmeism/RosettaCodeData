Yet another shortest path problem. Given two words of equal length the task is to transpose the first into the second.

Only one letter may be changed at a time and the change must result in a word in [http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt unixdict], the minimum number of intermediate words should be used.

Demonstrate the following:

A boy can be made into a man: boy -> bay -> ban -> man

With a little more difficulty a girl can be made into a lady: girl -> gill -> gall -> gale -> gaze -> laze -> lazy -> lady

A john can be made into a jane: john -> cohn -> conn -> cone -> cane -> jane 

A child can not be turned into an adult.

Optional transpositions of your choice.
