A "word wheel" is a type of word game commonly found on the "puzzle" page of
newspapers. You are presented with nine letters arranged in a circle or 3&times;3
grid. The objective is to find as many words as you can using only the letters
contained in the wheel or grid. Each word must contain the letter in the centre
of the wheel or grid. Usually there will be a minimum word length of 3 or 4
characters. Each letter may only be used as many times as it appears in the wheel
or grid.


;An example: <big><b>

;Task:
Write a program to solve the above "word wheel" puzzle.

Specifically:
:* Find all words of 3 or more letters using only the letters in the string &nbsp; '''ndeokgelw'''.
:* All words must contain the central letter &nbsp; <big>'''K'''.</big>
:* Each letter may be used only as many times as it appears in the string.
:* For this task we'll use lowercase English letters exclusively.


A "word" is defined to be any string contained in the file located at &nbsp; http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt. 
<br>If you prefer to use a different dictionary, &nbsp; please state which one you have used.

;Optional extra:
Word wheel puzzles usually state that there is at least one nine-letter word to be found.
Using the above dictionary, find the 3x3 grids with at least one nine-letter
solution that generate the largest number of words of three or more letters.
