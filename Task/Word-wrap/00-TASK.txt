Even today, with proportional fonts and complex layouts, there are still [[Template:Lines_too_long|cases]] where you need to wrap text at a specified column.  


;Basic task:
The basic task is to wrap a paragraph of text in a simple way in your language.  

If there is a way to do this that is built-in, trivial, or provided in a standard library, show that.  Otherwise implement the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_wrap#Minimum_length minimum length greedy algorithm from Wikipedia.]

Show your routine working on a sample of text at two different wrap columns.


;Extra credit:
Wrap text using a more sophisticated algorithm such as the Knuth and Plass TeX algorithm.  
If your language provides this, you get easy extra credit, 
but you ''must reference documentation'' indicating that the algorithm 
is something better than a simple minimum length algorithm.

If you have both basic and extra credit solutions, show an example where 
the two algorithms give different results.
