Wordiff is an original game in which contestants take turns spelling new dictionary words of three or more characters that only differ from
the last by a change in one letter.


The change can be either:
# a deletion of one letter; 
# addition of one letter; 
# or change in one letter.


Note:
* All words must be in the dictionary.
* No word in a game can be repeated.
* The first word must be three or four letters long.


;Task:
Create a program to aid in the playing of the game by:
* Asking for contestants names.
* Choosing an initial random three or four letter word from the dictionary.
* Asking each contestant in their turn for a wordiff word.
* Checking the wordiff word is:
:* in the dictionary, 
:* not a repetition of past words, 
:* and differs from the last appropriately.


;Optional stretch goals:
* Add timing.
* Allow players to set a maximum playing time for the game.
* An internal timer accumulates how long each user takes to respond in their turns.
* Play is halted if the maximum playing time is exceeded on a players input.
:* That last player must have entered a wordiff or loses.
:* If the game is timed-out, the loser is the person who took the longest `average` time to answer in their rounds.
