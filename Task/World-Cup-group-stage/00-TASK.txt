It's World Cup season (or at least it was when this page was created)! 

The World Cup is an international football/soccer tournament that happens every 4 years. &nbsp; Countries put their international teams together in the years between tournaments and qualify for the tournament based on their performance in other international games. &nbsp; Once a team has qualified they are put into a group with 3 other teams. 

For the first part of the World Cup tournament the teams play in "group stage" games where each of the four teams in a group [[wp:Round-robin tournament|plays all three other teams once]]. &nbsp; The results of these games determine which teams will move on to the "knockout stage" which is a standard single-elimination tournament. &nbsp; The two teams from each group with the most standings points move on to the knockout stage. 

Each game can result in a win for one team and a loss for the other team or it can result in a draw/tie for each team. 
:::* &nbsp; A win is worth three points.
:::* &nbsp; A draw/tie is worth one point. 
:::* &nbsp; A loss is worth zero points.


;Task:
:* &nbsp; Generate all possible outcome combinations for the six group stage games. &nbsp; With three possible outcomes for each game there should be 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 of them. 
:* &nbsp; Calculate the standings points for each team with each combination of outcomes. 
:* &nbsp; Show a histogram (graphical, &nbsp; ASCII art, or straight counts--whichever is easiest/most fun) of the standings points for all four teams over all possible outcomes.


Don't worry about tiebreakers as they can get complicated. &nbsp; We are basically looking to answer the question "if a team gets x standings points, where can they expect to end up in the group standings?".

<small>''Hint: there should be no possible way to end up in second place with less than two points as well as no way to end up in first with less than three. &nbsp; Oddly enough, there is no way to get 8 points at all.''</small>
