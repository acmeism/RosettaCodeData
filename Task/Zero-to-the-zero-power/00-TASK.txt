Some computer programming languages are not exactly consistent &nbsp; (with other computer programming languages) &nbsp; 
<br>when &nbsp; ''raising zero to the zeroth power'': &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><big>0<sup>0</sup></big></b>


;Task:
Show the results of raising &nbsp; zero &nbsp; to the &nbsp; zeroth &nbsp; power.


If your computer language objects to &nbsp; &nbsp; <big> '''0**0''' </big> &nbsp; &nbsp; or &nbsp; &nbsp; <big> '''0^0''' </big> &nbsp; &nbsp; at compile time, &nbsp; you may also try something like:
            x = 0
            y = 0
            z = x**y
            say  'z='  z


'''Show the result here.'''<br>
And of course use any symbols or notation that is supported in your computer programming language for exponentiation.
